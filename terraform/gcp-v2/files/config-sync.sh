# The rollout mechanism. Runs forever as a systemd service.
#
# Mirrors terraform/gcp/files/config-sync.sh's v1 mechanism exactly:
# Terraform writes a `grain-deploy-generation` attribute into instance
# metadata, and this service hangs on the metadata server's
# wait_for_change endpoint, re-fetching and running deploy.sh from
# metadata every time that value changes. No inbound SSH, no runner with
# credentials, no agent polling GitHub -- just `terraform apply` (or a
# metadata edit) changing one value the host is already watching.
#
# A failed deploy is retried on the next wake-up, so a transient failure
# (an apt mirror, a Docker pull, GitHub, a secret not pushed yet)
# self-heals without a second apply.
