#!/usr/bin/env bash
# gce-vm-smoke.sh -- prove that a GCP credential can actually run the GCE
# instance lifecycle: create a throwaway VM, SSH into it, delete it again.
#
# This is the "can we deploy at all" check for a credential, not a test of
# anything in grain. terraform/gcp stands a deployment up out of exactly
# these three verbs, and a `gcp-key` capability grant (pkg/capability/gcpkey)
# is supposed to buy a sandboxed agent the same. Both fail in ways that read
# as something else entirely when the credential is short a role -- see the
# three gotchas below, each of which cost a run of task 195 to diagnose -- so
# it is worth being able to answer "is the credential good?" in ninety
# seconds, on its own, before blaming terraform or the agent.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/gce-vm-smoke.sh [--zone Z] [--network N] [--subnet S] [--tags T]
#                           [--service-account SA|default] [--iap] [--keep]
#
# It authenticates as whatever gcloud already has active. From inside a
# grain sandbox holding the gcp-key capability, that means first:
#
#   gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=~/.gcp-service-account.json
#   gcloud config set project <project>
#
# Activating a key does not select a project, and gcloud's complaint when
# you skip the second line ("The required property [project] is not
# currently set") says nothing about the key -- so it gets misread as the
# key being bad.
