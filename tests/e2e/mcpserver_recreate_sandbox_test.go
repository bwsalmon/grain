// This file drives recreate_sandbox the way a dispatched run really
// does: a real `grain mcpserver -server <url> -task <id>` subprocess,
// asked over real stdio MCP to throw its sandbox away, against a real
// ui.Server whose Config.SandboxRecreate is a real
// orchestrator.SandboxRecreations -- with a real run registered in it by
// a real RunCycle, holding a real HostSandboxes directory with a real
// clone of a real repo, fetched through this world's real git proxy. So
// what comes back is a sandbox that has actually been destroyed and
// rebuilt, rather than a fake's canned account of one.
//
// Every layer of that chain is already covered on its own:
// pkg/mcp/recreate_sandbox_tool_test.go renders a report from a fake
// recreator, pkg/ui/sandbox_recreate_test.go carries a fake's answer over
// HTTP, and pkg/orchestrator/recreate_internal_test.go runs the restore
// steps against a real host sandbox and a real git remote. What none of
// them touch is the join, and the join is where the untested couplings
// are: the report's JSON round trip (Restored and Warnings are omitempty
// slices, so "grain put nothing back" and "grain put three things back"
// are the same shape on the wire until something decodes one), the
// shape a real HTTP client sees for a refusal as against a 404, and
// cmd/grain/mcpserver.go's daemonSandbox converting ui.SandboxRecreation
// into mcp.SandboxRecreationReport field for field with no compiler
// anywhere near the two ends.
//
// It also asserts the one claim the whole feature rests on and which
// only a real subprocess can show: that the tools a run was already
// holding still reach its sandbox afterwards. The mcpserver here is
// started before the rebuild and used after it -- to push from the
// restored clone with the re-minted credentials, through the same proxy
// -- because a rebuild that leaves the run unable to work in what came
// back would be no better than the wedged sandbox it replaced.
// pkg/orchestrator/kontur_docker_real_test.go makes the same argument for
// the other backend, where the address is a VM's container name rather
// than a directory path.
//
// ui.Config.SandboxRecreate is wired to a recreator of this file's own
// rather than to cmd/grain's sandboxRecreateAdapter, which is package
// main and not importable. That conversion is covered where it lives, in
// cmd/grain; what this file is for is everything outside that process.
