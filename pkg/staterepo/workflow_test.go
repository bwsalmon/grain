// The CI step as a deployment gets it: not a command somebody ran, but a
// file Seed and Sync put in the repository and keep there.
//
// Each property here is a way this could have gone wrong. A repository
// grain seeds ends up with the workflow without anybody asking. A
// workflow a merge dropped comes back. A workflow somebody edited is
// never touched again, because a file grain rewrote on a timer would be
// a file whose editor is fighting one. The image in a workflow nobody
// has edited follows the deployment across an upgrade, because a check
// running a build that knows another schema fails every pull request
// against this repository over nothing in the change. And a remote that
// will not accept a file under .github/workflows -- which is what GitHub
// says to a credential without the permission -- costs the deployment
// the CI step and nothing else: the commit is undone, whatever check was
// already there is left as it was, the export goes on, and grain tries
// again a day later rather than every thirty seconds.
