Put this in your backend.hcl:

  bucket = "${BUCKET}"
  prefix = "${NAME_PREFIX}/staging"

and set project_id = "${PROJECT_ID}", deployer_member =
"serviceAccount:${DEPLOYER_EMAIL}" in your tfvars.

Next: terraform init -backend-config=backend.hcl, terraform apply, then
run push-secrets.sh once (see this directory's README) to give the host
a GitHub token and a Gemini API key.
