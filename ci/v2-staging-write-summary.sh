# Write the v2 staging deploy's job summary. Runs with if: always(), so
# it must never fail the job itself -- every value is read null-safe and
# a missing one prints as empty rather than aborting.
#
# Required env:
#   GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY  set by the Actions runner
# Optional env:
#   URL, TUNNEL_COMMAND, INSTANCE, ZONE, PROJECT, DEPLOY_GENERATION
#
# Exactly one of URL and TUNNEL_COMMAND describes how to reach this
# deployment: a public load balancer, or IAP's TCP tunnel when
# expose_ui_publicly is off. Both empty means the apply did not get far
# enough to have outputs at all.
