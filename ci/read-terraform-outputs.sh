# Every value a later step reads as steps.<id>.outputs.<name> is written
# here. Adding a consumer without adding it here is the bug that made a
# v1 host come up with no GCP access at all (bwsalmon/agents#69): the
# expression resolved to empty rather than failing, so the step that
# minted and pushed the key was silently skipped. minter_service_account
# is exactly that shape again here -- push-secrets.sh mints no minter key
# at all when it is empty, and the gcp-key and gemini-key capabilities
# then have no credential to mint with.
