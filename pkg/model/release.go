// Release is one named release branch set -- bwsalmon/agents#571's
// replacement for bwsalmon/agents#398's single prod/rc ReleaseConfig per
// repo. Name is whatever a human chose when creating it ("myfeat", a
// feature branch's own name, or "2.1", a system version) and is what
// LatestBranch and ProdBranch are both derived from, so a release named
// "myfeat" always means exactly the branches "myfeat.latest" and
// "myfeat"; a release named "2.1" means "2.1.latest" and "2.1". Unlike
// ReleaseConfig, which was one singleton row per repo, a repo may have
// any number of Releases at once, each with its own name and its own
// independent sequence of candidates -- a feature release and a system
// release can be in flight side by side.
//
// Status walks provisioning -> active -> merge_requested -> merged,
// monotonically. A repo may have at most one Release by a given Name that
// has not yet reached ReleaseMerged (Store.CreateRelease's own
// ErrReleaseNameInUse) -- once merged, that Name is free again for
// "start a new release" (the issue's own "you merge it back to default
// and create a new release branch") to reuse, most often for the next
// version in the same line.
