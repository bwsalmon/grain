package e2e

// TestLiveIssueCompletesEndToEnd is agent/antigravity's own live gating,
// one layer up: it exercises the real agy binary against the same real
// store/gitproxy/git rig e2e_test.go's scripted tests do, so it runs in
// CI (where neither GEMINI_API_KEY nor agy is present) without failing,
// but proves -- wherever both are available -- that an unscripted model,
// left to decide its own tool calls, actually completes an issue the way
// the scripted tests assume a model would:
//
//	GRAIN_LIVE_AGENT_TEST=1 GEMINI_API_KEY=... \
//	  go test ./tests/e2e/... -run TestLiveIssueCompletesEndToEnd -v
//
// # Why this test is the only one that can see the config file's name
//
// agy has no --mcp-config: it reads its MCP servers out of the HOME it
// was started with, and agent/antigravity writes each run's own server
// into ~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json there. That path is a fact about
// agy's on-disk layout, not about grain, and nothing else in this
// repository can check it -- every other test that covers the wiring
// drives a scripted runner or a stub CLI, which reads whatever file the
// test itself was told to read. That is exactly how the wrong name
// (~/.gemini/settings.json, where Gemini CLI kept the same map) survived:
// the whole suite stayed green while a real agy loaded no MCP servers at
// all. See README's "Proving a live run actually gets the tools".
//
// So the roster is asserted here, up front and on its own, rather than
// left to be inferred from the run's outcome. An agy that loaded no tools
// still starts, still answers, and still fails this test -- but it would
// fail it at "the branch does not exist", which reads like a model that
// declined to push rather than like a run that was never given a way to.
//
// # GRAIN_LIVE_AGENT_TEST
//
// The two gates below skip, so this file costs CI nothing (no credential
// is available there, deliberately -- see .github/workflows/tests.yml).
// A skip is also indistinguishable from a pass in `go test`'s summary
// line, which is a bad property for the one test standing between this
// package and a config file agy never opens. Setting
// GRAIN_LIVE_AGENT_TEST turns both gates into failures, so a maintainer
// running this by hand finds out that it did not run.
