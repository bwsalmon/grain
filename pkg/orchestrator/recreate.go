// SandboxRebuilder is the optional half of Sandbox that can throw a
// sandbox's contents away and bring an empty one back under the same
// name -- what the recreate_sandbox tool (pkg/mcp) needs underneath it,
// and the one thing a run cannot do for itself from inside its own
// sandbox: an agent that has wedged its VM, filled its disk, or is
// sitting on a guest that stopped answering has no command it can run
// *in there* to fix any of it.
//
// Both backends implement it, and both do it by the same route their own
// Acquire already takes -- konturSandbox by deleting its VM and creating
// it again, hostSandbox by removing its directory and making it again --
// so what comes back is the same empty sandbox this run started with
// rather than a repaired version of the broken one. Repair is not on
// offer here and deliberately so: the whole value of the operation is
// that nothing of the old sandbox survives it.
//
// The name is what makes this possible at all without the run's tools
// going stale. A sandbox is addressed by name (a directory path, or a
// kontur VM whose container name follows from the VM name), never by a
// handle to the particular filesystem or guest behind it, so the tools
// already handed to this run -- and the ones its forked mcpserver holds
// in a separate process, which nothing here could reach to replace --
// address the new sandbox the moment it exists.

// daemon knows this run's shape, its proxy token, its capabilities and

// API -- exactly the hop open_pull_request already makes, and for the
// same reason: this is a write, and writes stay grain's.
//
