// bootstrap-playbooks, per that function's own doc comment), whether
// every secret it
// resolves through CapabilityContext.Credentials is actually set --
// registering is not the same as working, and a task granted an
// unready capability today only discovers that later as a refused
// resolution or a failed materialize.

// Ready answers "would this work if a task were granted it", which is a
// different question from "can a task be granted it at all" -- see
// Grantable, which is the half a deployment configured perfectly can
