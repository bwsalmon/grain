// What a load does when the remote is not there: the difference between
// "could not reach the remote" and "the repository says something this
// build must not overwrite", which is the difference between a
// deployment that goes on running and one that must stop.
//
// The remote here is a bare repository in a temporary directory, and
// "unreachable" is that directory moved out of the way -- which is what
// git reports for a network that is down, a credential that has expired
// and a repository renamed on GitHub alike: a fetch that did not
// complete, saying nothing at all about what the repository holds.
