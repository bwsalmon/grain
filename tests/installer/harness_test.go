// Package installer holds the end-to-end tests that actually run
// scripts/setup.sh.
//
// tests/container drives the *image*; this drives the *installer*. The
// distinction cost a deployment: a fresh VM came up with the config-sync
// service running, the grain image pulled, and no grain-daemon.service at
// all, because seed_gcp_minter_key staged a credential as root and then
// handed it to a `grain` that runs as $GRAIN_USER inside a container.
// Nothing in CI ran setup.sh, so nothing could have caught it -- every
// test either drove the image (which was fine) or read the script's text
// (which looked fine).
//
// So this runs the script, as root, on the machine running the tests, and
// then asks systemd whether the deployment it was supposed to produce is
// actually there and serving. What it deliberately does *not* do is
// sandbox the script: it creates a real system user, writes real units
// into /etc/systemd/system, and starts a real service, because a fake of
// any of those is a fake of the thing that broke.
//
// That makes it destructive to the host it runs on, which is why the gate
// below is as narrow as it is: a throwaway CI runner, never a developer's
// laptop, and never without being asked explicitly.
//
//	GRAIN_TEST_IMAGE      the image to deploy, e.g. `grain-e2e:test`.
//	GRAIN_INSTALLER_E2E=1 explicit opt-in. Without it every test here
//	                      skips even where everything else is available,
//	                      because "the tests took over
//	                      /usr/local/bin/grain" is not a surprise anyone
//	                      should get from `go test ./...`.
//	root                  via passwordless sudo; setup.sh refuses otherwise.
//	systemd + docker      the two things the deployment is made of.
//
// Kontur sandboxing stays off (GRAIN_KONTUR_ENABLE=0). It is the one part
// of a deploy that needs nested virtualisation and a multi-minute
// debootstrap, and the failures this file exists to catch are all in the
// path every deployment takes.
