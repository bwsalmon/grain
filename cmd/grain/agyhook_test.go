// The "agy-tool-hook" subcommand is the whole of what agy sees of
// grain's native-tool denial: agy runs this binary before every tool
// call a run makes, hands it the call on stdin, and reads the decision
// back off stdout. antigravity.HookDecision holds the policy and has its
// own tests; what has never been covered is this end of the pipe -- the
// bytes the subcommand actually writes, and the fact that it writes none
// at all when it has no opinion.
//
// That is the part that broke. The first version of this answered a call
// it had no opinion about with `{}`, on the reading that an object
// carrying no decision carries no opinion; agy reads a decision-less
// object as a deny, so a run so configured was refused *every* tool call
// it made, grain's own included, and could do nothing but say why
// (commit 3601f158, and antigravity.noOpinion for the measured
// contract). Nothing in the Go suite noticed: HookDecision's own tests
// asserted on the value it returned, and the subcommand that writes it
// to a file descriptor had no test at all.
//
// So these assert on the bytes, and deliberately on emptiness rather
// than on "not a deny": zero bytes is the one reply agy takes as "no
// opinion", and any JSON at all -- including valid, empty JSON -- is
// something else.
