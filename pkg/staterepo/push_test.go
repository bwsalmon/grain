// What happens to a commit whose push failed, on a deployment that then
// goes quiet.
//
// The push is the one step of a sync that talks to anybody else, so it
// is the one that fails on its own -- a remote that is briefly
// unreachable, a credential that expired between the commit and the
// network call, a remote that will not take what it is offered. The
// commit is already made by then and stays on the host, and what these
// tests pin down is that the next tick carries it out even when the
// database has stopped changing and there is nothing whatever left to
// commit. That is the state a deployment sits in for hours otherwise,
// and it is the window in which a merged pull request turns an unpushed
// export into a divergence (diverge.go).

// to reach the remote on the first tick that can reach it.
