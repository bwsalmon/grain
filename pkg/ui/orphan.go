// PullRequestComments is implemented by whatever can post grain's own
// words on a pull request -- cmd/grain/daemon.go's own adapter over that
// deployment's GitHub client, in a real deployment. Named here and filled
// there for the reason PullRequests is: this package does not import
// pkg/orchestrator or pkg/github, and cmd/grain is where both ends are in
// scope.
//
// ref is a model.PullRequestRef's String() -- "owner/name#123", the same
// spelling a task's own fixes-link carries -- so the implementation
// parses it back rather than this package handing over a type the wire
// shape does not otherwise use.

// PullRequestCloser is the same shape for the one call in grain that
// destroys work rather than making it: closing a pull request on GitHub
// without merging it.
//
// Deliberately its own interface, and its own Config field, rather than a
// second method on PullRequestComments. Leaving a comment and closing a
// pull request are not the same power, and a deployment that hands its UI
// the first has not thereby handed it the second: a Config with
// PullRequestComments set and this one nil can say everything it has to
// say and cannot shut anything. Splitting them is what makes that
// possible to express at all.

// errNoPullRequestComments is the echo failure recorded on a deployment
// whose UI was never handed a GitHub client (Config.PullRequestComments
// nil). It reads as a reason, because that is what it ends up being: it

// this note on the pull request itself: ..." completes the sentence.
var errNoPullRequestComments = errors.New("this deployment's UI is not wired to a GitHub client")

// errNoPullRequestCloser is the same for Config.PullRequestCloser, and

// on the task, which is where somebody who ticked the box and found the
// pull request still open should be told why.

// noteOrphanedPullRequests says, on a task just closed and on each pull
// request still linked to it, what closing the task has done to it -- the
// telling model.OrphanedPullRequestNote's own doc comment explains the
// absence of -- and, when the human asked for it, closes that pull
// request first.
//
// Called only from setClosed, which is the *human* close: the other
// writer of Observation.ClosedAt is orchestrator.SyncPullRequests, which
// sets it when the pull request itself merged or was closed on GitHub,
// and there is nothing orphaned about a task closed because its work
// landed. A note there would be a lie on every merged task grain has, and
// a close there would be grain shutting a pull request nobody asked it to
// -- which is why the choice is a CloseOptions argument on this one path
// and not a setting anything else could read.
//
// Ordering is deliberate. The pull request is closed first, then told,
// then the task is told last, so that whether each earlier step worked is
// part of what the next one says -- a GitHub call that fails (a
// credential that cannot comment or close, a deployment with no client at
// all) then costs the close nothing at all, and leaves no silence behind
// it either. It is the one arrangement where a best-effort call is
// neither swallowed nor able to fail the close: this package has no
// logger to lose it to, and a close that returned 500 because a comment
// did not post would read as a close that did not happen.
//
// Closing before commenting, specifically, is what keeps the words
// honest: the comment says which of the two things happened, and it
// cannot say that before the attempt. A refused close leaves exactly the
// orphaned pull request grain would have left had nobody asked, and says
// so in those words plus the refusal.
//
// The already-noted check is what keeps a second close (close, reopen,
// close again) from posting a second copy on GitHub, where nothing would
// dedupe it -- Store.NoteOrphanedPullRequest's own write-time check
// covers the task's copy, but only this one comes early enough to cover
// the pull request's. It gates the telling and not the closing: somebody
// who ticked the box on a second close asked for the pull request to be
// shut, and a note already on the task about the first close is no reason
// to ignore them.
