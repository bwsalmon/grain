// bwsalmon/agents#417: nothing in cmd/grain or pkg/orchestrator was named
// (or did) anything like restart/resume/recover/crash before this file --
// every other test here drives RunCycle/RunDispatch to completion within
// one process and one store connection, so none of them can tell a clean
// finish apart from a process that died partway through and got restarted
// against the same on-disk store. The two tests below kill a real sqlite
// connection (the only state a restart cannot recover -- see
// openStoreInDir) at the two points RunDispatch's own doc comments
// already worry about: after dispatch.Cycle's own durable write but
// before anything else runs at all, and after a capability is minted but
// before revokeAll/FinishRun ever get to record what became of it.
