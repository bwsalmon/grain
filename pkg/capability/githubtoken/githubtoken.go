// Package githubtoken is the capability behind each named GitHub token a
// deployment has configured beyond its default one (grain/task-117): a
// task granted one pushes and pulls through that token instead of the
// one its repo would otherwise fall back to.
//
// **One provider per token, not one provider with a name argument in the
// grant.** A grant is a capability id and nothing else (model.Grant), so
// "use the release-bot token" has to *be* an id -- model.
// GitCredentialCapability's "github-credential:<name>" -- rather than a
// parameter carried alongside one. That is what lets the whole existing
// machinery work unchanged: the picker offers a row per token
// (ui.GitHubTokenCapabilities), a human ticks one, and the id lands in
// task_grant like any other. Providers builds the matching set of
// providers from the same names, so a granted token is one
// model.ResolveGrants finds a provider for rather than refusing as
// unregistered.
//
// **A SELECT capability: it mints nothing and places nothing.** The
// token never enters the sandbox -- pkg/gitproxy's whole shape is that a
// run's route to GitHub is grain's, never the agent's -- so there is
// nothing here to materialize into a file and nothing to revoke.
// What actually takes effect is the proxy asking the store, per request,
// which credential this sandbox's live task named
// (model.Store.GitCredentialOverride -> gitproxy.GitProxy.
// selectCredential), and that reads the grant itself. Materialize
// records the choice as Materialization.CredentialOverride all the same,
// which is the field model/capability.go defines for exactly this kind
// of capability, so a dispatch's own record of what it applied says
// which token the run was routed through.
//
// **Which tokens exist is an operator's file, not a setting.** The
// names come from the credential ladder's own directory
// (gitproxy.CredentialSet.ExtraNames -- a <name>.token or
// <name>.app.json under secrets/github), the same place the default
// token lives, and are read once at startup like the rest of that
// ladder: "replace a file under /data/secrets and restart the one
// service that reads it" (docs/design.md). Adding a token is therefore
// adding a file; what this package adds is that the file is then
// something a human can attach to one task without editing
// credentials.json and changing every repo's default at once.
//
// **One thing here does reach GitHub: the credential check** --
// CheckCredential (check.go), the "test this credential" action Settings
// offers beside every other standing credential. Nothing about a
// dispatch changed for it: the check is handed the same ladder the proxy
// resolves through and asks GitHub what it still accepts, rather than
// this provider growing a client or a token of its own. See check.go's
// own doc comment.
