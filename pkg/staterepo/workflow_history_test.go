// A state repository's CI step is installed once and lives in somebody
// else's repository from then on, so what grain will and will not do to
// it afterwards is the whole of this file.
//
// grain decides by byte equality with a template, which is the only test
// that tells an operator's runner or added step from grain's own text
// without deciding what a workflow is allowed to say. Matching only the
// *current* template made that test say "not grain's" about every file
// grain had already installed the moment the template's comment block
// was reworded -- so those repositories kept whatever image they were
// installed with, forever, and no fix to this file ever reached a
// deployment that had one. The templates grain has retired are kept in
// workflow_history.go for that reason, and these are the properties that
// makes: an earlier grain's file is adopted, one somebody edited is
// still theirs, and an edit to the template that forgets to record the
// text it replaced fails here rather than silently stranding everybody.

// day deployments started installing the file until commit b898473e,
// and so the one every state repository that already has a check is
// carrying. Written out here rather than reached for through the
// package's own unexported list, because "grain recognises its own

// text, which came out of git and not out of this build.

# grain writes this file whenever it is not here -- on the sync after a
# merge dropped it, or the first sync after a deployment adopted this
# repository -- and never rewrites one that is. So an edit to it is
# safe: pin the image below, change the runner, add a step of your own,
# and grain leaves what you wrote alone. To have the check run somewhere
# else instead, put your own file here; to stop grain offering it at
# all, set "noWorkflow": true in the deployment's state-repo.json.
#
# This repository is a grain deployment's database, written out as text
# (see README.md), so a pull request against it is a change to what that
# deployment runs. The one question a reviewer cannot answer by reading
# the diff is whether the result will load: a file that is not valid
# JSON, a row missing a column the schema insists on, or a link naming a
# row that is no longer in the dump all read as perfectly plausible text
# and fail at import time -- which, without this step, means after the
# merge, on the deployment, in front of whoever is on call rather than
# whoever wrote the change.
#
# ` + "`grain state check`" + ` is that import, run against a database it throws
# away afterwards: the same single transaction, the same constraints, the
# same rollback on any inconsistency. It needs no credential, no data
# directory and no daemon, only a checkout -- which is why this whole job
# is a checkout and one ` + "`docker run`" + `.
#
# On pull requests only, deliberately. grain commits to this repository
# itself, on a timer, straight to its branch, every time its database
# changes; validating those pushes would spend a CI run each time a task
# changed state, on a dump grain had just written out of the very
# database the check would import it back into.
#
# The image is grain's own published container -- its entrypoint is the
# grain binary, and the package is public, so this step needs no
# credential and no secret. It does have to be a build that knows the
# same schema as the deployment: ` + "`grain state check`" + ` refuses a dump
# stamped with any other, so a failure reading "repository is at schema
# N, this build knows M" means this tag and the deployment have drifted
# apart. Point IMAGE at the tag that deployment runs --
# ` + "`grain state status`" + ` on its host prints both numbers.
