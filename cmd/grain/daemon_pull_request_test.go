package main

// The daemon side of open_pull_request: the two pieces of cmd/grain glue
// that stand between a run's own mcpserver and
// orchestrator.OpenPullRequestForTask.
//
// Every layer around them is covered elsewhere -- pkg/mcp renders the
// report, pkg/ui carries it over HTTP, pkg/orchestrator opens the real
// pull request against a githubsim -- and all of those run against a fake
// standing in for the layer below. What is left over is the join, and
// the join here is two field-for-field conversions between three structs
// that deliberately do not import each other
// (orchestrator.PullRequestStatus -> ui.PullRequestStatus ->
// mcp.PullRequestReport, see ui.PullRequestStatus' own doc comment on
// why), plus the gate that answers before runDaemon has built a GitHub
// client at all. A swapped Repo and URL, a dropped ChecksError, or
// ChecksKnown wired to the wrong side of ChecksAvailable all compile and
// pass every test named above, so these run the whole controller-side
// chain in one process against a real store and a real
// github.RESTClient.
//
// The last test is the outer end of that chain: mcp.PullRequestReport
// <- ui.HTTPClient <- a real ui.Server <- pullRequestOpener <-
// orchestrator <- githubsim, which is where a mismatch between the two
// conversions shows up as a wrong answer rather than as a compile error.
