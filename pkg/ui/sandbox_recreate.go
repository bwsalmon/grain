//
// This exists for the agent, not for the browser: a dispatched run
// reaches it through the recreate_sandbox tool its own MCP server
// exposes (pkg/mcp, wired in cmd/grain/mcpserver.go), which is how a run
// that has wedged its sandbox -- or landed on one that is failing for
// reasons of its own -- gets a clean one without losing the turns it has
// left. Nothing about it is agent-specific, though, and a human calling
// it by hand against a stuck run gets the same clean sandbox.
//
// It refuses a task with no live run here rather than doing nothing
// quietly: a sandbox exists only while a run does, so there is nothing
// to rebuild and nothing that would be improved by pretending otherwise.
