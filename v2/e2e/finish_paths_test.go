// This file is two more of bwsalmon/agents#337's ten: both are
// ProcessResult/SyncPullRequests endings orchestrator's own unit tests
// prove in isolation, but that nothing in this package had ever driven
// through a real dispatch, a real githubsim and a real bare repo before.
//
//   - TestAgentCompletesByCommentingWithNoPushOpensNoPullRequest is
//     ProcessResult's third ending (finish.go): no push, no question, just
//     a comment_on_issue call -- "the run produced nothing to act on
//     [besides that]" is a completion, not a failure, and it must open no
//     pull request at all. Every other test in this package that reaches
//     model.StateCompleted gets there through a real push; this is the one
//     path that never touches git.
//   - TestSyncPullRequestsClosesATaskWhosePullRequestWasClosedWithoutMerging
//     is healthFrom's own doc comment made concrete: a pull request GitHub
//     reports "closed" folds into the same PrClosed outcome whether or not
//     it was ever merged, so a task whose PR a human declined must close
//     out cleanly too -- with no MergePullRequest call, and nothing of the
//     agent's branch ever landing on main.
//
// Both reuse mergequeue_conflict_test.go's own worldSandboxes (a real
// gitproxy-fronted world's already-credentialed slots, adapted to the
// orchestrator.Sandboxes interface RunCycle wants) and cli_test.go's own
// scriptedFramework, rather than building either again.
