// run_deadline.go is the half of "a run knows how long it has" that
// reaches an agent at turn 200.
//
// orchestrator.BuildPrompt states the budget in the prompt, which is the
// right place to state it and the wrong place to leave it: the prompt is
// read once, hours before the deadline it describes actually matters,
// and by the turn where committing early would have saved the work it is
// the furthest thing from the model's attention. A tool result is the
// opposite -- it is the one piece of text a run reads every single turn.
//
// So once the run is inside RunDeadlineNoticeWindow of its wall-clock
// deadline, every tool result carries a line saying how much is left and
// what to do about it. The "what to do" half is deliberate: a bare
// number is a fact a run can note and ignore, while "push what works
// now" is the actual behaviour the deadline calls for, and grain knows
// which it wants. What is at stake is specific -- salvagePushedBranch
// rescues a branch that was pushed when the clock runs out, and nothing
// rescues a commit that was not -- so the line says that too rather than
// leaving an agent to guess how much of its work the cancellation eats.
//
// The same deadline is also handed to the handlers themselves, on their
// ctx (runDeadlineContextKey). A notice is advice a tool prints after
// the fact; a tool that *blocks* has to know the number beforehand, to
// bound itself by it -- see wait_for_checks, which is the reason that
// half exists.

// RunDeadlineNoticeWindow is how much of a run's wall-clock budget has
// to be left before its tool results start saying so. Sized against
// orchestrator.DefaultMaxRunRuntime (two hours): a sixth of it, which is
// long enough for a run to finish the change it is in the middle of,
// commit it, push it and watch one round of CI -- the sequence the
// notice exists to get started before it is impossible.
//
// It is an absolute window rather than a fraction of the budget because
// what a run has to do with the time is absolute: pushing and waiting on
// CI takes as long as it takes whether the budget was two hours or
// twenty minutes. A deployment that sets a very short MaxRunRuntime
// therefore has every tool result carry the notice from the first turn,
// which is not a bug -- such a run is near the wall for the whole of its
// life, and that is worth saying on every turn of it.

//
// An absolute time rather than a duration because this process is not
// the one the clock started for: an mcpserver is forked by the CLI some

// decides how long to block *before* it answers -- a run with eight
// minutes left that asks for a fifteen-minute wait spends the whole of
// its remaining life inside one tool call, is cancelled mid-wait, and so
// never sees the verdict it blocked for nor gets the turn it would have
// used to act on it. So the deadline the registry holds is put on the
// ctx every handler runs under, and a tool that can bound itself by it
// reads it from there (waitForChecksBudget).
//
// On the ctx rather than through the tool constructors because the
