// TestRunLiveDispatchesAndOpensAPullRequest is the daemon's own version
// of tests/e2e/live_test.go's TestLiveIssueCompletesEndToEnd and
// pkg/orchestrator/live_test.go's TestRunCycleCompletesEndToEnd: the
// closest thing to actually running `grain daemon` this repo can check
// in. It calls run() itself -- the exact function daemon() (daemon.go,
// what main() calls for a "daemon" argv[1]) calls, not a stand-in --
// against a real embedded SQLite store, a real in-process git proxy, a
// real *github.RESTClient pointed at a local server standing in for
// GitHub (git smart-HTTP plus the handful of REST endpoints
// orchestrate.openPullRequest needs, served by githubsim.Sim), and the
// real Gemini API. Gated on GEMINI_API_KEY exactly like the other two,
// so it runs nowhere without a live key (including CI) and costs nothing
// when skipped:
//
//	GEMINI_API_KEY=... go test ./cmd/grain/... -run TestRunLiveDispatchesAndOpensAPullRequest -v -timeout 20m
//
// The -timeout is part of the invocation rather than an afterthought:
// how long a live run takes is the model's business and not this test's,
// so `go test -timeout` is what bounds one here -- see the pacing
// constants below and liveDaemonContext, which read it.
//
// One gap this test works around rather than hides: neither
// pkg/orchestrate.prepare() nor pkg/orchestrator.BuildPrompt tells a
// dispatched agent what URL to clone -- the sandbox's git credentials
// are scoped to the git proxy's own (ephemeral, local) host, which
// nothing puts in the prompt (see both tests/e2e/live_test.go's and
// pkg/orchestrator/live_test.go's own prompts, which hardcode the remote
// they built themselves for the same reason). Filed as its own issue
// rather than fixed here, since the daemon's run() is what this file
// tests, not pkg/orchestrate's prompt-building. The prompt below routes
// around it exactly the way a real dispatched agent would have to today:
// by reading its own ~/.git-credentials to discover the one host it has
// been handed a credential for.

// The clocks the live daemon tests in this package run on -- this one and
// daemon_true_e2e_test.go's, which shares every helper below.
//
// Only one of them is about the agent, and it is a ceiling rather than an
// expectation: liveRunBudget is how long the model is *allowed* to take,
// not how long it is assumed to take. What these tests actually wait for
// is the run reaching a terminal state (awaitFinishedRun), and every
// assertion after that is about what the finished run left behind rather
// than about the wall clock.
//
// That distinction is the point. Both tests used to hand the daemon a
// fixed context -- 200 and 240 seconds -- and carve fixed windows out of
// it, which made the model's pace an assertion nobody had written down.
// Against a live agy 1.1.26 on gemini-3.1-pro-high, single agent_response
// steps of 89 seconds were measured, alongside runs that pushed within 40
// seconds and runs that had not pushed after 180; three consecutive runs
// of the kontur test gave one full pass, one "pushed, PR opened, task
// never closed" and one "never pushed", with nothing wrong in any of them
// but the clock. Worse than the flake was what it read as: "pushed but no
// pull request" is exactly what a broken finish path looks like, so a
// third of the runs of this suite accused grain of a regression it did
// not have.
//
//   - liveRunBudget bounds the daemon, and so the agent. Eight minutes is
//     several times what a healthy run needs and is there for the
//     pathological case only -- a run still going at the end of it is
//     reported as precisely that, and as nothing else.
//   - liveFinishWindow is grain's own pace, and the one window here that
//     measures something this repository controls: RunDispatch stamps a
//     run finished immediately before runOne calls ProcessResult
//     (cycle.go), so the pull request follows a couple of GitHub calls
//     behind the finished row -- never a model turn behind it.
//   - liveGitOps and liveMergeWindow are the same kind of window at the
//     far end of the kontur test: a simulated human's real git merge, and
//     the daemon's own next reconcile tick noticing it. Both are grain's
//     and git's pace rather than an agent's.
//   - minLiveRunWait is the point below which there is no sense starting:
//     a wait this short cannot see even a fast run through, so a test
//     given less says so up front instead of failing on the clock later.
