package ui

// repoSummaries' own tests -- what `grain repo list` is a rendering of.
// They live in package ui rather than ui_test because the function is
// unexported: the three sources a repo can come from (the allowlist, a
// task's target, stored configuration of its own) are exactly what is
// worth testing
// directly, and going through HTTPClient.ListRepos to reach them would
// only add a server to the setup of every case.
