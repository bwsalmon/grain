package orchestrator_test

// TestLiveTaskSuiteUntilCleanFindsAndFixesABugThenStops is bwsalmon/
// agents#642's own live confirmation: the issue asks specifically to
// "confirm that the 'run until no repo changes or new issues' pattern
// works for a standard bug finding workflow with real agents" before the
// feature is trusted. Every other test in this package proves
// SyncTaskSuites' own pass-to-pass bookkeeping against a scripted
// agent (suites_test.go) or pure store state (this package's own
// suites_test.go in the orchestrator package); none of them can say
// whether a *real* model, given nothing but a task suite's own prompt
// and a real git checkout, actually behaves the way that bookkeeping
// assumes -- finds and fixes a genuine bug on one pass, then correctly
// reports "nothing to do" on the next once that fix has landed, rather
// than hallucinating a change or looping forever. This is what checks
// that, gated on GEMINI_API_KEY exactly like this package's own
// live_test.go and pkg/agent/antigravity's own live test, so it costs
// nothing and runs nowhere (including CI) without a live key:
//
//	GEMINI_API_KEY=... go test ./pkg/orchestrator/... -run TestLiveTaskSuiteUntilCleanFindsAndFixesABugThenStops -v -timeout 5m
//
// The scenario: a tiny real repo seeded with one genuine, findable bug
// (calc.py's add() subtracts instead of adding). A task suite in
// TaskSuiteUntilClean mode, one item, targets it:
//
//  1. Pass 1 dispatches a real agent against the buggy checkout. It is
//     expected to find the bug, fix it, and push -- OutcomeOfPass reads
//     that as PassChanged (a pull request was opened), so the run fires
//     a second pass rather than stopping.
//  2. The test plays GitHub's part and actually merges that pull
//     request into the branch the suite is running against (a real git
//     merge over the same bare repo, githubsim.Sim.mergeIntoBase) --
//     the run's own "stack against the source branch" is what makes
//     this matter: pass 2 clones that same branch, so it only sees the
//     fix if it actually landed there first.
//  3. Pass 2 dispatches a second real agent against the now-fixed
//     checkout. It is expected to find no bug, leave a closing comment
//     (the template's own instruction: comment_on_issue, not silence --
//     see the comment below on why silence does not read as "clean"
//     here), and push nothing -- OutcomeOfPass reads that as PassClean,
//     and the run stops, succeeded, without needing MaxPasses.
//
// If a real agent cannot be trusted to behave this way, this test is
// where that shows up -- as a failure here, not as a support ticket
// after the feature ships.
