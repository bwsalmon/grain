// "Is there a database here at all", from both ends: the rows and the
// files.
//
// The pair is load-bearing and is a pair of judgements rather than a
// fact, which is why it is pinned here. Both discount the schema stamp,
// because model.Store.Init writes it into a database the moment it
// creates one and the export writes it out again -- so a database that
// counted it would never read as empty and the guard would never fire,
// and a dump that counted it would read as holding a deployment on a
// brand new install and refuse the first export every deployment makes.
// Neither failure says anything when it happens.
