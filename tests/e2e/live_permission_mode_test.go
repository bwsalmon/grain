// TestLiveRunWithoutThePermissionOverride measures the one thing that
// stands between grain and dropping --dangerously-skip-permissions from
// every dispatch: whether a run in agy's own permission mode can still
// reach its sandbox through grain's own tools.
//
// # Why this is a live test and not an argument
//
// Run passes --dangerously-skip-permissions, which agy's init event
// reports as permission mode "always-proceed". While it does, the
// permission rules grain writes into every run's settings.json stop
// nothing -- a live run holding that exact block ran agy's own list_dir,
// one of the names it denies, to completion -- and the PreToolUse hook is
// the only thing actually refusing a native call. That makes the rules
// look like dead weight worth either enforcing or deleting, and enforcing
// them means dropping the flag.
//
// What makes dropping it dangerous is the failure it would produce.
// Without the flag a run is in request-review mode, and agy's changelog
// describes a headless run there as soft-denying anything that would need
// a confirmation, naming the allow rule that would have permitted it. So
// the risk is not a run that is merely stricter about agy's own tools:
// it is every dispatch able to do nothing at all, because grain's tools
// are the only ones that reach a sandbox and they would need permitting
// too. permissionRules writes them into the allow list in their exact
// eagerly registered spelling (mcp_grain-sandbox_run_command and
// friends), since agy matches an approval rule strictly unless it is
// prefixed "regex:" -- and TestLiveAgyLoadsGrainsPermissionRules already
// proves those rules reach the binary. What no test proves is that the
// spelling they are written in is the one agy's permission check compares
// against, which is the same class of question ("does the name arrive in
// the shape the rule is written in") that the hook payload log answers for
// the hook. Only a real agy driving a real model can answer it, so this
// test asks.
//
// # What it asserts, and what it only reports
//
// The verdict is one file: grain's own run_command, asked to write into
// the sandbox, either wrote it or did not. That is asserted, because it is
// the whole of what the decision turns on and a run that cannot write it
// is a deployment-wide outage waiting to be shipped.
//
// Everything else here is reported rather than asserted. Which native
// tools a model reaches for is not grain's to guarantee, and what agy does
// to one in request-review mode -- refuse it at the permission check
// before grain's hook is asked, refuse it at the hook as it does today, or
// let it run -- is the finding this test exists to record, not a property
// grain depends on. The exception is the controller's filesystem: a native
// tool that writes there fails, in this mode exactly as in the other,
// because that is the property the whole denial exists for.
//
// The control is agy's own init event. A run whose permission mode came
// back "always-proceed" measured nothing at all -- the flag would still be
// in Run's argument list, or this agy would default to the override -- and
// that is a fatal error rather than a pass, since a vacuous measurement
// answering "safe to drop the flag" is the worst outcome available here.
//
// It is gated exactly like its neighbours (an unset GEMINI_API_KEY or a
// missing agy skips, unless GRAIN_LIVE_AGENT_TEST makes that a failure)
// and run by the same nightly workflow, because what it measures drifts
// with the agy binary the same way everything else in live-agent.yml does.
