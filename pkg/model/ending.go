package model

// How a run ended, as a vocabulary rather than as a sentence.
//
// task_run.outcome is deliberately open (schema.go keeps enums out of the
// DDL) and deliberately coarse, and the coarseness hides exactly the
// distinctions worth acting on. "cancelled" is both "a human closed the
// task while its run was live" -- routine, nobody's fault, nothing to fix
// -- and "the run hit its wall-clock cap", which is a run whose work was
// cut off mid-flight. "failed" is both "the agent CLI died" and "the run
// exhausted its turn budget without ever producing a final answer". Each
// of those has a different fix, and counting task_run.outcome strings
// cannot tell any of them apart.
//
// The distinction is not stored, because it does not have to be: it is
// already in task_run.detail, which the paths below write. What was
// missing was a way to read that detail back as a fact rather than as
// prose, which is what EndingOf is -- the reader half of the sentences
// this file also owns the writing of.
//
// Owning both halves here is the point. The phrases orchestrator records
// and the phrases a report matches on used to be able to drift apart
// silently, at the cost of a metric that quietly reads zero forever; now
// there is one definition of each, in the package that owns the column
// they land in, with ending_test.go asserting the round trip.
