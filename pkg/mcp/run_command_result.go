// run_command_result.go is what both transports' run_command turn an exit
// status and two streams into, so that the two answer identically.
//
// Two things are added to the exit=/stdout:/stderr: shape they have
// always returned:
//
//   - a line when the *bound*, not the command, is what ended it. Every
//     run_command is bounded -- defaultRunCommandTimeout applies even
//     when the call passed no "timeout" at all -- and neither transport
//     used to say so: locally the answer was `exit=-1`, which is also
//     what "the command could not be started" looks like, and remotely a
//     bare `exit=124` from the guest's own `timeout`. Neither named the
//     number, and when it is the default it is a number the run never
//     chose and cannot see. The failure mode that costs is re-running the
//     same long command verbatim, twice, before concluding the sandbox is
//     broken.
//   - a cap on how much of the two streams comes back, described in
//     result_size.go.
