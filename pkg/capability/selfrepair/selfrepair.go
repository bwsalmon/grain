// Package selfrepair is a GRANT model.CapabilityProvider: a task
// holding it gets a tool to run shell commands directly on the host
// grain's own controller runs on -- restart a systemd unit, poke at
// grain's own config, call the grain CLI itself, anything a person at
// that host's own terminal could do -- bwsalmon/agents#540's
// "configuration mode." ui.OfferedCapabilities' own "self-repair" row
// has named this since before there was anything behind it; this is
// that provider.
//
// Unlike selfdebug's read-only tools, everything here is capable of
// changing grain's own running state, so every call is gated on a live
// human reply in the task's own chat before it runs -- this package's
// first real instance of a tool that pauses mid-run for a person to
// approve or refuse it, rather than a grant a human decided about once,
// before the run ever started. See Confirm's own doc comment for how
// that pause works, and orchestrator/cycle.go's runOne for why this
// capability's tools are only ever added to an Interactive task's run:
// nobody is necessarily watching a non-interactive task's chat closely
// enough to answer within Confirm's own timeout.

// Confirm posts question as a comment on taskID's own conversation,
// marks the task awaiting that reply (model.Observation.
// PendingQuestionCommentID, the same field ask_question's own post-run
// handling sets -- so a human watching the task list sees "awaiting
// reply" the instant this run pauses, not only once it eventually
// finishes), and blocks -- polling Comments every pollInterval -- until
// a human replies or timeout elapses.
//
// This is deliberately a synchronous wait inside one tool call, not
// grain's usual "park the whole run, pick the reply up on the next
// dispatch" pattern (mcp's own ask_question) -- the point of an
// Interactive task is that someone is on the other end right now, so
// there is a turn boundary worth waiting across here that an unattended
// run would not have. It only works at all because the caller already
// holds *model.Store directly and is running in the same OS process as
// the reply it is waiting for.
//
// Nothing satisfies that today. It was true while the default framework
// was a home-grown in-process Gemini API loop that registered a run's
// tools in-process and so could call straight into this function; both
// frameworks that remain (agent/antigravity and agent/claude) drive a
// real CLI as a subprocess and ignore agent.RunConfig.Tools entirely,
// because there is no in-process registry to hand a forked process. So
// orchestrator.Config.GrantTools still assembles these tools and
// RunDispatch still passes them, but no Framework consumes them: an
// Interactive task's confirmation prompt is not reachable by a running
// agent until the "mcpserver" subcommand grows a route back to the store
// (it takes only a sandbox root or a kontur VM today -- see
// cmd/grain/mcpserver.go). This function itself is unchanged and still
// correct for any caller that does hold the store in-process.
//
// approved is false, with reply explaining why, whenever a human
// answers no, the wait times out, or ctx is cancelled (the task closed,
// or the run was otherwise stopped) -- refusing, not running, is always
// the safe default for a call this function cannot resolve cleanly.
