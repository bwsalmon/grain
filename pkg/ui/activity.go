// MaxActivityLength is how long a run's synopsis of itself may be, in
// runes. It is a display constraint rather than a storage one: the phrase
// is rendered on a task row beside the title, and one that runs past a
// line stops being a glance and starts being a paragraph nobody reads.
//
// Enforced here, at the daemon, rather than only in the tool that calls
// it (mcp.MaxStatusLength names the same number to the agent): this is
// the write, and a limit checked only where the polite caller happens to
// be is not a limit.

// Activity is what one task's live run says it is doing right now, as
// POST /api/tasks/{id}/activity answers -- the phrase as it was stored,
// and when it was stored.
//
// Live is false when the task had no run in flight to record anything
// against, which is a 200 rather than an error: a run whose call lands
// just after grain has already finished it has done nothing wrong, and
// the honest answer is "nobody is listening any more", which the tool
// then passes on to the agent.

//
// This exists for the agent, the same way RecreateSandbox next door does:
// a dispatched run reaches it through the update_status tool its own MCP
// server exposes (pkg/mcp, wired in cmd/grain/mcpserver.go), which is the
// only route a run has back to the daemon that dispatched it. Nothing
// about it is agent-specific, though, and it is deliberately not a state
// change: the note is a phrase to read, never anything grain acts on, so
// the worst a wrong one can do is mislead a person for as long as it
// stands.
//
// The note is normalized before it is stored -- whitespace collapsed onto
// one line -- because it is rendered as a single line and a caller that
// sends two is better served by having them joined than by having the
// second silently cut off.
//
// A task with no live run is not an error. The run may have been
// cancelled or finished between the agent writing the call and the daemon
// reading it, and there is nothing for either side to repair; the answer
// says so in Live, and the tool tells the agent that its status is no
// longer being shown.
