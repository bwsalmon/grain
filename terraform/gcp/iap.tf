# Exposes the staging UI at dns.tf's local.dns_name over HTTPS, protected
# by Identity-Aware Proxy -- bwsalmon/agents#394's own "protected by iap."
#
# IAP for a web UI (as opposed to the IAP *TCP* tunnel ssh_source_ranges
# already gives SSH, in network.tf) is a property of a global external
# Application Load Balancer's backend service, not of the instance
# itself: Google's edge terminates TLS, requires a Google sign-in and an
# roles/iap.httpsResourceAccessor grant before a request ever reaches the
# backend, and only then forwards it, over plain HTTP, to the instance's
# *internal* IP -- which is why google_compute_instance.host needs no
# external IP of its own (network.tf's assign_external_ip) and why
# ui_port only has to be reachable from Google's own load-balancer
# ranges (network.tf's lb_to_ui firewall rule), not the internet.
