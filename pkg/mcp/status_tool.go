// MaxStatusLength is the longest synopsis update_status will send, in
// runes -- the same limit the daemon enforces on the write
// (ui.MaxActivityLength), stated here so a call that is too long is
// refused where the agent can still shorten it in the same turn rather
// than after a round trip.
//
// It is a display constraint: the phrase lands on a task row beside the
// title, and one that runs past a line stops being the glance it exists
// to be.

// StatusReport is what one update_status call did: whether the run's task
// was still live to record it against.
//
// Live false is not an error. A run's status can only be shown while the
// run is happening, so a call that lands after grain has already finished
// the run has nothing to attach to -- the run has done nothing wrong, and
// the answer says so rather than failing.

// StatusReporter records a one-line synopsis of what the run this server
// serves is doing, against that run's own task.
//
// An interface, and one that names no task, for the reason
// PullRequestOpener and SandboxRecreator next door name none: which task
// a synopsis lands on is fixed at process start (`grain mcpserver
// -task`), never by anything in a tool call, so an agent can only ever
// describe its own run. The real implementation
// (cmd/grain/mcpserver.go's daemonStatus) asks the daemon over its REST
// API, since the row being written lives there.

// NewStatusTools returns the one tool a run gets when its dispatch can
// carry a synopsis back to the daemon: update_status.
//
// It exists because "running" is all a task said for as long as it ran.
// A run is dispatched, its row reads 'running', and half an hour later it
// still does -- with nothing on it to say whether that half hour went on
// a slow test suite, a wait for CI, or an agent going in circles, until
// somebody opens the transcript after the fact. The tool lets the run
// answer that question itself, in a phrase, while there is still time for
// the answer to be worth something.
//
// Like open_pull_request and recreate_sandbox, and unlike NewMockTools'
// escape hatches, this takes effect immediately rather than when the run
// ends: a synopsis relayed after the fact would describe a run nobody is
// still watching. Unlike either of those, it changes nothing about the
// run -- grain never reads the note back, dispatches nothing differently
// for it, and a run that never calls it is treated exactly as one that
// does. It is a line of text for a person, which is also why it is the
// one tool here that is safe to call as often as the run has something
// new to say.
//
// reporter nil returns the tool anyway, refusing every call -- what lets
// each agent framework's allowedTools enumerate the names this package
// registers without holding a live reporter, exactly as
// NewOpenPullRequestTools and NewRecreateSandboxTools do.
