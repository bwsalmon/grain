// This file is the one test that runs a real `grain mcpserver` process
// and asks it, over real stdio MCP, what GitHub says about a branch --
// the chain cmd/grain/mcpserver.go's -github-insecure-http flag was
// added for and which nothing had ever driven end to end.
//
// Every link in that chain was already covered on its own:
// pkg/agent/{claude,antigravity} prove the right argv is built,
// cmd/grain/mcpserver_test.go proves those flags resolve to a reader
// scoped to one branch, and pkg/mcp/pullrequest_tools_test.go proves a
// scoped reader renders the right answer. What none of them touch is the
// join -- argv -> flag.Parse -> gitproxy.LoadCredentialSet ->
// github.NewRealTransport plus UseTLS -> github.NewClient -> the tool --
// where several of the couplings are string-typed and one is a bool with
// no compiler anywhere near it. A misspelled flag name, a credential
// ladder path that does not exist under a real data directory, or UseTLS
// inverted would each pass every test listed above and fail every real
// run, so this drives the whole thing as a subprocess against a
// githubsim served over plain HTTP: the very "local mock GitHub in a
// live test" the flag's own help text describes.
//
// The last subtest is the one an operator actually hits. pullRequestTools'
// doc comment promises nothing about GitHub access is fatal here, because
// every other tool this process serves is how an agent touches its
// sandbox at all -- exiting over unreadable CI would turn a missing
// credential into a run that cannot edit a file. That promise had no
// test; it does now, and it is checked by editing a file through the same
// process afterwards rather than by reading a message.
