// board.js is the Kanban board's own layout: which columns there are,
// which of model.State's states each one collects, and how a set of
// tasks falls into them (grain/task-287).
//
// # Why a board's columns are a *setting* at all
//
// A board is the flat list's answer to a different question. The list
// answers "what is the backlog, in order"; the board answers "where is
// everything right now", and that only reads as an answer if the
// columns match how this deployment actually works. grain has eight
// states and no two operators want the same eight columns: one wants
// proposed and queued side by side because approving is the daily job,
// another wants a single "waiting on me" column holding awaiting_reply,
// failed and awaiting_submit, because those are the three that never
// move on their own. Neither is a default worth hard-coding over the
// other, so the columns are edited (BoardColumnsOverlay.jsx) and kept.
//
// # Where they are kept, and why not in the daemon
//
// localStorage, under BOARD_STORAGE_KEY -- the same treatment the theme
// mode gets (ThemeModeContext.jsx), and for the same reason: this is
// how one person wants to look at the deployment, not a fact about the
// deployment. Nothing behind /api/config changes when a column is
// renamed, no run behaves differently, and an operator with a phone and
// a laptop is allowed to want different columns on each. It also means
// the whole feature is a UI change with no schema, no settings key and
// no migration behind it.
//
// The cost is that a browser's stored layout can be older than the
// build reading it, which is what normalizeColumns below is for: a
// stored column naming a state this build has never heard of, or a
// stored value that isn't a board at all, falls back rather than
// throwing at render time.
//
// # What a column can and cannot do
//
// A column is a set of states, so "which tasks show up" is answered by
// the columns themselves: a state no column names is off the board
// entirely, which is how "closed" is hidden by default without a
// toggle of its own. What a column cannot do is move a task: a task's
// state is derived by the daemon from what has actually happened to it
// (model.StateOf), not stored as a field the UI could set, so there is
// no drop that could put a queued task into "Running". Dragging a card
// reorders the backlog within its own column and nothing else -- see
// TaskBoard.jsx.

// suggested, what is waiting to run, what is running, what is stuck on a
// human, what is waiting to land -- with the three states that never
// move on their own ("Awaiting reply", "Failed", "Awaiting submit")
// collected into one column, because they are one question: what needs
// me.
//
// "Closed" gets no column. It is the same judgement the list makes with
// its "Show closed tasks" checkbox (config.showClosedByDefault): a
// finished task is not part of "where is everything right now", and a
// board whose widest column is the archive says nothing. Adding a
// column for it is two clicks in the editor for whoever disagrees.

//   - it has to be a non-empty array of objects; anything else is not a

//   - a state this build doesn't know is dropped, and a state named by
//     two columns stays only in the first. Otherwise a layout stored by
//     a newer build would render a column of tasks that can't exist, or
//     one task would appear twice on the same board
//   - a column with no title left gets its states' own labels, or
//     "Untitled", rather than rendering as a nameless column
//   - ids are made unique, since they key the rendered columns
//
// A column left holding no states survives on purpose: it is a real
// thing to have on a board you are still building, it renders as an
// empty column saying so, and dropping it would silently undo an edit
// somebody made.
