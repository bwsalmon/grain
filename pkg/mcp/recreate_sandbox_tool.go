// reason renderPullRequestReport prints lines rather than JSON: the
// reader is a model deciding what to do next, and "your repo is cloned
// again but your git credentials are not" is the useful shape of that
// answer, not a status code.

// SandboxRecreator destroys the sandbox this server's run is working in
// and builds an empty one under the same name, putting back what grain
// itself had set up in it.
//
// It is an interface here, and one that takes no arguments, for the same
// reason PullRequestOpener next door is. Creating and destroying
// sandboxes is grain's: this process holds nothing but a transport into
// a guest, and the shape of the VM to build, the token to mint for it
// and the repo to clone into it are all facts about the run that live in
// the daemon. So the real implementation (cmd/grain/mcpserver.go's
// daemonSandbox) asks the daemon over its REST API, which rebuilds the
// sandbox of whichever run that task currently has. Nothing an agent can
// put in a tool call chooses which sandbox is destroyed -- it can only
// ever be its own.
//
// It is also the one tool here that destroys something, which is why it
// takes the same route as open_pull_request rather than being something
// a run does for itself: a write, made where grain already makes writes.

// NewRecreateSandboxTools returns the one tool a run gets when its
// dispatch can rebuild its own sandbox: recreate_sandbox.
//
// This is the tool for the failure an agent otherwise cannot do anything
// about. Every other tool here runs *inside* the sandbox, so a sandbox
// that has been broken badly enough -- a filesystem left in a state no
// command can untangle, a full disk, a wedged process, a guest that has
// simply stopped answering -- takes every one of them down with it, and
// the run spends the rest of its turns failing at things that have
// nothing to do with its task. Until now the only way out was for the
// run to end and the whole task to be redispatched, which throws away
// the agent's context along with the broken sandbox.
//
// Like open_pull_request, and unlike NewMockTools' escape hatches, its
// effect is real and immediate rather than deferred to the end of the
// run: the entire point is that the agent carries on working
// afterwards, in the sandbox this call built.
//
// recreator nil returns the tool anyway, refusing every call -- what
// lets each agent framework's allowedTools enumerate the names this
// package registers without holding a live recreator, exactly as
// NewOpenPullRequestTools does.
