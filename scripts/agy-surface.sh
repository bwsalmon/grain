# agy-surface.sh -- read agy's surface off the installed binary and write
# it down as Markdown: every flag, subcommand, changelog entry and model
# name it will admit to, what it does with a HOME it has never seen, which
# of several candidate paths it actually reads its customizations from,
# and the config keys sitting in its string table.
#
# Why this exists. agy is a ~200MB stripped Go binary whose only
# documentation is what it prints, it is installed unpinned (the
# Dockerfile fetches whatever antigravity.google/cli/install.sh is serving
# that day), and pkg/agent/antigravity depends on a dozen facts about it
# -- three config paths, a hook contract, a flag set, a model catalog --
# that nothing in this repository can check for itself. Every task that
# has had to re-answer "what can agy be configured to do?" has re-derived
# it by hand, and a grain sandbox cannot: no network beyond the git proxy,
# and no agy in the image. So the derivation lives here instead, as a
# script CI runs on demand (.github/workflows/agy-surface.yml), and its
# output is committed to docs/agy-surface.md -- where the next question
# costs one dispatch, and the next agy release shows up as a diff.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/agy-surface.sh [-o docs/agy-surface.md]
#
# The binary is $AGY or $GRAIN_AGY_PATH, defaulting to `agy` on $PATH --
# the same resolution order the daemon's own -agy-path flag has.
#
# Two rules shape what goes in the output.
#
# Nothing here may fail the run. Every probe is a question this script
# does not know the answer to -- that is the point of asking the binary --
# so a command that exits non-zero, times out or prints nothing records
# exactly that and the script carries on. A probe that stopped answering
# (`agy -p /permissions` wanting a credential, say) is a finding, and it
# belongs in the diff rather than in a red job.
#
# And the output has to be stable enough that a diff means drift. Nothing
# run-specific goes in it -- no dates, no run numbers, no temporary paths:
# every capture is scrubbed of the throwaway HOMEs it was taken in and
# every extracted list is sorted, so that two runs against the same agy
# produce the same bytes and a run against a different agy produces a diff
# that is entirely about agy.

# Not -e: see the first rule above. A probe's failure is an answer.

# agy's surface, read off the binary

Everything the installed `agy` will say about itself, captured by
`scripts/agy-surface.sh` and regenerated on demand by
`.github/workflows/agy-surface.yml` (`workflow_dispatch` only, no
schedule, no credential). `pkg/agent/antigravity` depends on a dozen facts
about a binary nothing in this repository can check -- its flags, its
config paths, its hook contract, its model catalog -- and that binary is
installed unpinned, so what a freshly built image carries can change on a
day nobody touched this repository. This file is the binary's own answer,
in the tree, where a re-derivation costs one dispatch and a new agy
release arrives as a diff.

Read it as evidence rather than as documentation: every section below is a
command and its output, the commands that failed included. A probe that
stopped answering is itself a finding. What was made of the first such
capture is README's "agy 1.1.26 has no denylist for its own native tools",
and the caveat recorded there governs everything here -- agy ignores an
unknown key in silence, so a key appearing below is not proof that writing
it does anything.

printf 'agy is stripped, but a Go binary carries every struct tag, every JSON-schema description and every literal path its own code names. This is where the keys a settings file may use come from -- with the caveat this file opens with: an unknown key is ignored in silence, so a key appearing here is not proof that writing it does anything, and a *known* key given a value that does not parse can drop a whole agent without a word.\n\n'

printf 'Two things shape the patterns below, and the first capture is what taught them both.\n\n'

printf 'The `json:"..."` tags are not dumped whole. There are ten thousand distinct ones in this binary, because a 200MB Go program that bundles an AWS SDK, a JSON-schema library and most of a browser carries their struct tags too; dumped whole they truncate in alphabetical order, and the first capture spent four hundred lines on `AbsoluteKeywordLocation` and `AccessKeyID` under a heading promising the keys a settings file may use. They are asked for by subject instead -- tools, permissions, hooks, MCP, agents, sandboxing -- which is both shorter and the actual question.\n\n'

printf 'And the camelCase probes are anchored to whole strings (`^...$`). A Go string table has no delimiters between its entries, so an unanchored pattern reads straight across the join and invents names: the first capture'"'"'s roster section offered `allowedAmountfeeParametersgetFeeBalanc` and `hookStubInputBlockingCharzend`, neither of which is anything. Anchoring costs the names that appear only inside a longer literal and buys a list where every entry is a name some Go code actually uses.\n\n'
