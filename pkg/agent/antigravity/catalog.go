// This file is the other half of what this package knows about agy: not
// how to drive a run, but what the installed binary says it can run at
// all. `grain settings -gemini-model` and the Settings pane behind it
// used to be a free-text field over a vocabulary only agy knows -- a
// deployment that typed a name agy has never heard of learned so on the
// next dispatch, as a run that failed before it started ("--model
// gemini-3.1-pro requires --effort" being the friendliest of them). The
// catalog is a fact about the binary on this host, it changes when that
// binary is upgraded, and asking it is one subprocess -- so the UI asks
// rather than making an operator remember (grain/task-365).
//
// It is read as evidence rather than as an API, the same reading
// docs/agy-surface.md's own preamble asks for: agy prints a human
// listing, not JSON (1.1.26's `agy models --help` offers no
// --output-format, whatever its changelog says arrived later), so
// everything below is parsing text a release could reword. Every failure
// path therefore ends somewhere a human can still type a model name by
// hand: Catalog returns an error rather than a guess, the API reports
// that error beside an empty list, and the field it feeds stays writable.

// Model is one entry of agy's own model catalog -- `agy models`' own id
// and human label, plus the two things grain reads out of the id.
type Model struct {
	// ID is the name --model takes, e.g. "gemini-3.1-pro-high".
	ID string
	// Label is agy's own display name for it, e.g. "Gemini 3.1 Pro
	// (High)". Empty for a listing that printed an id and nothing else.
	Label string
	// Effort is the reasoning effort the id carries as a suffix ("high"
	// for the example above), or "" for a name that carries none. agy's
	// catalog spells effort into the name rather than leaving it to
	// --effort, and refuses either half on its own -- see DefaultModel.
	Effort string
	// Family is ID with that suffix removed ("gemini-3.1-pro"), which is
	// what makes the several efforts of one model group together on a
	// picker. Equal to ID when Effort is empty.
	Family string
}

// ModelCatalog is what one installed agy answers about itself: the models
// it will accept for --model, and the reasoning-effort vocabulary its own
// --effort flag documents.
//
// Efforts is that vocabulary as the binary states it rather than as
// Efforts() hard-codes it -- the wider of the two answers a picker can
// give, and the one a future agy that added or renamed a word would be
// read through. Which efforts a *given* model has is a narrower question
// that neither answers, and the ids do: gemini-3.1-pro is listed high and
// low and never medium, which is exactly the pairing agy refuses at the
// start of a run.
type ModelCatalog struct {
	Models  []Model

// Efforts() is what a catalog falls back to when agy's own --help no
// longer spells the vocabulary out: the same three words this package
// already validates a stored effort against, which is what 1.1.26
// documents and what every model name in its catalog is suffixed with. A
// guess only in the sense that it is not this binary's own answer, and it
// never overrides one that parsed.

// Catalog asks the agy binary at agyPath what models it can run.
//
// apiKey is the deployment's own Gemini API key, passed exactly as Run
// passes it -- in the environment, never in argv, with GOOGLE_API_KEY
// cleared alongside so an unrelated key exported on the controller cannot
// become the one this answer is billed against. It is needed because
// `agy models` fetches the catalog rather than reciting a compiled-in
// list ("Fetching available models..."), and an unauthenticated agy
// answers with a login demand instead. An empty key is not an error here
// for the same reason it is not one in Run: a deployment may mean agy to
// authenticate from its own ambient session.
//
// The subprocess runs under a private HOME holding nothing but the
// settings file that makes agy read GEMINI_API_KEY at all -- the same
// reasoning as writeAgyHome, minus the per-run MCP config and hooks a
// listing has no use for. It is emphatically not the controller's own
// ~/.gemini: reading a catalog must not touch, and must not depend on,
// whatever session a human left there.
//
// Bound it with the context. `agy models` is a network call and this is
// reached from an HTTP handler.
