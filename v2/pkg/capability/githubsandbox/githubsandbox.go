// Package githubsandbox is the "github-sandbox" capability: a MINT
// provider (docs/data-model.md, model/capability.go) that creates a
// private, single-use GitHub repo under a dedicated bot account and
// pushes a token scoped to just that repo into the sandbox --
// bwsalmon/agents#354.
//
// **A GitHub App, not a bot-account PAT.** GitHub has no API to mint a
// personal access token for an account -- that can only be done
// interactively, through the web UI -- so nothing short of a GitHub App
// installation token can be minted programmatically, per repo, on
// demand. An App installation access token is exactly the shape
// bwsalmon/agents#354 asked this capability to hand the agent: real,
// GitHub-enforced scoping to one repo and a chosen permission set that
// structurally excludes changing that repo's visibility or settings
// (never request the "administration" -- or, for the org-level call
// that creates the repo, "organization_administration" -- permission on
// the token the sandbox actually receives), rather than a broader
// standing credential the agent is merely asked nicely not to misuse.
//
// bwsalmon/agents#159 built exactly this once before, in the v1 Python
// controller, and bwsalmon/agents#186 reverted it back to a single
// broad PAT: JWT-signing by shelling out to openssl, and two
// independent minting call sites that each had to re-derive a fresh
// token on their own clock, for scoping a single deployment did not
// need (see grain/automation/scratch_repo.py's docstring). Neither
// objection carries over here: Go's stdlib-adjacent crypto/rsa (via
// golang-jwt/jwt) signs the App JWT with no subprocess, and app.go is
// this package's one minting call site, called fresh for every
// Materialize/Revoke/Reap the same way gcpkey's own NewMinter is
// (see that package's doc comment) -- so this reopens bwsalmon/
// agents#186's decision deliberately, not by accident, in a setting
// where its reasons no longer apply.
//
// **Setup is still one App, not "username and password"** -- the
// literal secret shape bwsalmon/agents#354 first asked for turned out
// to be unbuildable (no API mints a PAT), and scripting GitHub's own
// login page to drive the App-manifest flow is unreliable against any
// account with two-factor authentication, which a dedicated bot account
// is squarely in scope for GitHub now requiring. `grain controller
// bootstrap-github-app` (cmd/grain/controller.go) is the low-effort
// middle ground that was agreed instead: it prints a pre-filled
// manifest URL an operator opens once, in their own browser, logged in
// as the bot account, and pastes back the resulting code -- no
// password ever reaches grain, no scraping, no 2FA fragility. What
// comes out the other end -- an App ID and a private key -- are this
// capability's two secrets (DefaultAppIDCredential,
// DefaultPrivateKeyCredential).
//
// **No org-level config, deliberately.** Nothing here names which
// account the App belongs to: FindInstallation (app.go) asks GitHub,
// at Materialize/Revoke/Reap time, which single account the App is
// installed on, and refuses (rather than guessing) if that isn't
// exactly one -- one less thing bootstrap-github-app or an operator's
// flags have to get right, and one less place a typo'd org name could
// quietly mint into the wrong account.
//
// **A 1-hour lease is GitHub's own ceiling, not a choice.** An
// installation access token cannot be minted with a longer lifetime,
// so unlike gcpkey/geminikey's 24-hour leases (this package's own
// ReapAfter, for the same "clean up if leaked" backstop, still is 24
// hours -- that bound is about how long a stray *repo* survives, not
// how long the token handed to any one run stays valid) a run needing
// git access past about an hour will find its credential stale. That
// is a real, current limitation of handing the agent a raw token up
// front at Materialize time rather than minting one on demand through
// an MCP tool call mid-run; see bwsalmon/agents#354's own issue thread
// for why this package took the simpler shape instead.
