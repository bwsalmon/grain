// The two failure shapes are deliberately different, because the pane
// does two different things with them. Available false is a UI that was
// never wired to a lister (`grain demo`, a UI not colocated with the
// daemon that has the binary): nothing to ask, so the model field is a
// plain text box exactly as it was before this endpoint existed.
// Available true with an Error is a lister that was asked and could not
// answer -- an agy that is not installed, a Gemini key that is missing or
// spent, a listing whose shape this build cannot parse -- and that is
// worth saying out loud, next to the same text box: the vocabulary is
// agy's, this deployment could not read it just now, and a model name
// typed by hand still saves.
//
// So a failure here never costs an operator the ability to set a model.
// That is the whole design constraint (grain/task-365): the picker is a
// convenience over a setting that has always been free text, and it must
// not become the only way to change one.

// fetch from a failed probe to render the same fallback would be reading
