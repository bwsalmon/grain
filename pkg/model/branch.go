// repo from the repo page. This should just create the given branch in
// github," plus grain/task-176's own "if a branch already exists on a
// repo, we should be able to add it to grain." Name is exactly the ref a
// human typed; Status walks pending -> created (grain cut the ref) or
// pending -> adopted (the ref was already there), the same declarative-
// intent-then-reconcile shape Release already holds to.
