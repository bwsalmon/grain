# Grains: options considered

Companion to [`grain.md`](grain.md), which says what was decided. This
holds what was weighed against it: the paths not taken, the conditions
that would reopen them, and the places the reasoning changed on contact
with the code.

It exists so that a decision is not re-litigated from scratch, and so that
"we should have done X" has an entry to argue with.

## Poll versus push

Five options for how the controller learns a grain's state:

1. **Poll via exec** — `grain status` per grain per tick. Chosen first,
   then reduced to a fallback, then deleted; see below and "Removing the
   status exec".
2. **Push with a credential** — the shim holds a token and posts to the
   daemon's REST API. This is what grain does today for `update_status`,
   `open_pull_request` and `recreate_sandbox`.
3. **Attached stream over exec** — a persistent exec per grain, exec
   transport with push semantics.
4. **Poll via shared volume** — the shim writes `status.json` to a
   hostPath the controller reads directly.
5. **Status records on the container log stream**, read with the runtime's
   own listing. ***Chosen.*** Not on the table at first, because the log
   stream was scoped to the trajectory; it arrived once the trajectory
   moved there and the question "why is this a second channel?" had an
   obvious answer.

Option 5 keeps everything that made option 1 right — the controller
reaches in, the grain never dials out, each read is a whole snapshot — and
drops the one thing that made it cost something, a process per grain per
tick. The reasoning below is written against option 1 because that is what
it was written to defend; every argument in it is an argument for the
direction rather than for the exec, so it carries over unchanged.

**Push forces NAT, and the network decision deliberately keeps flat
available.** Under flat the splice steals the container's ingress, so it
can send but never establish a connection — there is no HTTP push from a
flat-mode grain at all. Choosing push would close a door the network
section leaves open. This is the argument specific to this design rather
than to polling in general.

**Silence is information under poll and ambiguous under push.** An
unreachable grain is `PhaseLost` with a rule for it; a grain that stopped
pushing might be dead, wedged or idle with nothing to tell them apart. So
push systems grow a heartbeat, which is a poll rebuilt with the failure
detector inside the thing it monitors.

Beneath that: **poll is level-triggered and push is edge-triggered, and
edges get lost.** A push landing while the controller restarts is gone, so
push needs retry, at-least-once, idempotency keys and dedupe. `Reconcile`
rests on level-triggering entirely.

### What push would have bought

Recorded so neither is rediscovered as an argument.

**Latency**, in exactly one place. `ask_question` waits on a human;
`open_pull_request` and `wait_for_checks` are fine at tick granularity;
cancellation is controller-to-grain and push-shaped already. The one
signal that suffers is the live trajectory — handled by container logs
instead.

**Scale.** Poll is O(grains × ticks), push is O(events). This does not
bite at a single-operator cluster's size. **If it ever does, the answer is
a node-local aggregator the controller polls once per tick, making it
O(nodes) — not push.** Written down so "polling does not scale" is not
later read as "we should have pushed": the aggregator keeps every property
above, and push forfeits all of them.

### The credential objection, disclaimed

It would be easy to argue against push because it needs a credential in
the container. That argument is weak. The container is the *trusted* side —
untrusted code is in the guest, behind vsock — so a token there sits beside
the model credential already present.

The real cost is the **authorization surface**: what a token may do, scoped
to which grain, minted when, revoked when, and what happens when a grain
claims to be a run it is not. `pkg/gitproxy` is ~1,900 lines and much of it
is exactly that. Not danger; work, and a place bugs live. Push also
reinstates the daemon hops the local-versus-forwarded rule had just
finished deleting.

### Transport is not the interface

`List` says nothing about how state is gathered, which is why option 5
could replace option 1 without the interface moving, and why option 4
stays available underneath it. On the docker backend the controller and
its grains share a host, so a hostPath is strictly cheaper than the log
API with identical semantics; it stops working across nodes.
`KonturGrains` may choose it; nothing above it needs to know.

That the read went from a process per grain per tick to two calls per
tick, with no signature change but `Observe`'s removal, is the property
working.

## Why the control channel is not itself MCP

Asked when the controller still called into the shim: the traffic looked
like MCP tool calls and grain already speaks MCP, so why was it a CLI?
Kept because the reasoning is what eventually removed the channel
altogether rather than choosing a protocol for it.

**MCP assumes a session; `Reconcile` assumes there is not one.** MCP's
transports — stdio and Streamable HTTP — open with an `initialize`
handshake negotiating protocol version and capabilities before any other
request. Per poll that is three messages before the controller learns
anything, on a channel where each round trip is a container exec, against
one exec returning one document. Held open instead, it is the persistent
connection "poll, not push" rejected.

Level-triggering is the deeper mismatch: a session is state shared between
two parties, which is what that decision removed.

**There are two relationships and they are not the same shape:**

| | shape | protocol |
| --- | --- | --- |
| agent ↔ shim | one session for the run's life | **MCP** (`pkg/mcp`, unchanged) |
| controller ↔ shim | no calls at all | a stream and a listing |

The second row started as "independent level-triggered calls, the CLI" and
got shorter twice — first when status moved onto the log stream, then when
the fallback exec went too ("And then the fallback went too", below). The
argument against MCP there is now moot in the strongest way: there is no
channel to choose a protocol for.

What MCP would have contributed is taken from elsewhere anyway: version
negotiation is the wire version plus image labels (Kubernetes' string form
rather than `initialize`'s); error codes are `grain run`'s own exit code,
which the runtime reports in the container status; progress notifications
are the container log stream, which survives a disconnected controller and
replays from `--since`.

### Open option: MCP frames as the trajectory

`src: "agent"` records have no defined vocabulary, and each of
`pkg/agent/claude`, `/antigravity`, `/codex` owns a transcript reader
because "the two event vocabularies differ".

The shim *is* the agent's MCP server, so every call it serves is already
JSON-RPC in its hands and could be mirrored into the trajectory verbatim
as the `agent` records — one well-specified vocabulary across every
framework, at no cost to produce.

Narrower than it was when there was an upstream to relay, and the guest
CLI is why: what the shim now sees is the six sandbox tools, so the
mirror covers `run_command` and its siblings but not what an agent asks
of the controller, which is an argv inside a `run_command` rather than a
frame of its own. It never covered the model's prose either, so the
per-framework readers do not fully disappear.

## The network

The container needs egress because the agent moved into it. Four ways,
and one rejected on purpose.

### B. NAT — *chosen*

Bridge plus masquerade in the pod netns, `eth0` unspliced. Works in every
environment with no cluster provisioning, which is the deciding property.
Costs are in [`grain.md`](grain.md); the two that matter are the loss of
infrastructure-level differentiation and conntrack as a new failure class.

Also true, and worth recording so it is not rediscovered as an objection:
**guest egress is unaffected** (git proxy, registries, all work through
masquerade); **attribution survives**, since the git proxy identifies
callers by bearer token, not source IP — there is no `RemoteAddr` anywhere
in `pkg/gitproxy`; **`kontur exec` is unaffected**, being vsock; **grain
resolves no VM address at all**, so nothing breaks for want of one; and
**address allocation is close to free**, because kontur is one VM per pod
so every guest can share a private subnet — the old `-ip`/`-port` flags
were for a topology with several VMs per namespace. **PMTU improves**: a
splice has "no bridge or router in between to fragment an oversized frame",
where NAT has a router in the path.

### C. A second NIC on the netns-holder

Attach a second network to the netns-holder container; `eth0` is spliced to
the guest and `eth1` stays the container's. netshim splices exactly
`NETSHIM_EXTERNAL_IFACE` and tc filters are per-device, so the second
interface is untouched.

Under docker this is a few lines in `KonturGrains.Acquire` and **no kontur
change at all** — `-docker-run-opt` exists because the netns-holder "is the
only place a caller's own docker options can go"
(`internal/dockervm/docker.go:175`). Prefer `docker network connect` after
netshim has run over a second `--network` at create: with two networks at
create time docker does not guarantee which becomes `eth0`, and splicing
the wrong one hands the guest the wrong network *and* leaves the container
spliced.

It keeps what NAT gives up — two interfaces means two addresses, so
infrastructure policy can distinguish agent from sandbox — and adds no
conntrack.

**Why not:** it does not generalise. On kontur's standalone kubelet the CNI
conflist is kontur's own, but a conflist is a chain over *one* interface, so
a second NIC needs a small custom chained plugin (~200 lines; kontur already
vendors `vishvananda/netlink`) or Multus. On a managed cluster it is cluster
provisioning — additional VPC subnets, node pool configuration, Dataplane
V2.

**Take this if grain stays on the docker backend permanently**, where it is
strictly cheaper and strictly better-separated than NAT.

### A. An exec tunnel

The shim binds a loopback listener (loopback is untouched by the splice);
the agent's framework is pointed at it with a base-URL override. The
controller attaches with `docker exec -i` — never `-t`, which would break
8-bit cleanliness — and multiplexes streams over that pipe.

Two variants, and the difference matters:

- **A dumb TCP tunnel** forwards bytes; the agent does TLS end to end and
  holds the credential itself. Solves connectivity only.
- **A terminating proxy** takes plain HTTP on loopback and the controller
  adds the `Authorization` header before re-issuing upstream. **The
  credential never enters the container** — strictly better than any other
  option. It needs the CLI to accept a base-URL override (`claude` and
  `codex` have the standard env vars; `agy` needs checking), so it degrades
  to the dumb variant per framework.

It mirrors `pkg/gitproxy` with one simplification and one complication: no
token is needed, because the exec's far end is unforgeable — the controller
chose which container to exec into, so the pipe *is* the authentication. But
`gitproxy` buffers `UpstreamResponse.Body []byte`, which is right for git
and fatal for SSE, so the forwarder needs streaming `io.Copy` through a
flushing writer both ways.

**Why not:** a bespoke data plane, and on a managed cluster every model call
— full prompts and streamed responses, for every grain at once — traverses
the API server, which has its own timeouts and connection limits.

**Take this if NAT's conntrack behaviour bites**, wherever a cluster's CNI
cannot be modified, or **wherever keeping flat mode is worth a bespoke data
plane** — a tunnelled grain needs no network at the container layer at all,
so the rule selects flat and neither of NAT's costs is paid. That last is
the strongest case for it.

### D. Routing container egress through the guest

Rejected, and recorded as rejected on purpose rather than overlooked. The
guest has working network and the control link exists, so a route would
need no new machinery, and TLS protects the traffic end to end. But it puts
the sandboxed thing in the path of the thing sandboxing it: guest-side code
could observe or block the agent's own control channel.

### Why there is no carve-out within flat

`splice.go`: each direction is a tc ingress qdisc plus a match-everything
filter with `mirred` egress-redirect, so frames reach the tap at L2 and the
namespace's IP stack never sees them. Discriminating replies-for-the-namespace
from replies-for-the-guest would need L3/conntrack-aware classification
inside what is deliberately a match-all L2 wire — and the two ends share a
MAC by design, so there is nothing to match on at L2 either.

## Configuration delivery

**Where it landed:** scalars in the environment, everything else as files
under `/grain`, all before the container starts.

**A correction on the way.** An earlier draft delivered the credential and
placements over an exec's stdin, on the grounds that an environment
variable shows up in a Kubernetes pod spec. That was wrong about how
Kubernetes does this: `valueFrom.secretKeyRef` puts a *reference* in the
pod spec while the value stays in a Secret, with its own RBAC — `get
secrets` being distinctly more privileged than `get pods` — and its own
encryption at rest. Under docker the argument was always weak: reading the
environment needs the docker socket, which is root-equivalent and can read
the process's memory regardless.

**Then files won anyway, for a different reason.** A Kubernetes Secret or
ConfigMap volume *is* the placement model — `items: [{key, path, mode}]`
gives files at chosen paths with chosen modes — so there is no encoding to
invent, no ARG_MAX ceiling, nothing in `/proc/1/environ`, and a non-secret
placement can come from a ConfigMap where an environment blob could not
have told it apart from a secret.

**What stayed in the environment** is what has no shape: the wire version,
the framework name, the max runtime, and kontur's own `CHV_*`.

**Setup as a file** rather than a string, though kontur's own
`CHV_SETUP_SCRIPT` carries its script's text — fine for a line or two, and
grain's is composed from a clone, a branch checkout, the repo's setup
command and whatever the prompt needs read back. As a file it has a
shebang, an executable bit, and something a human can `cat`. (kontur gained
`CHV_SETUP_SCRIPT_PATH` for the same reason; see its branch.)

## Placements: the destination field, removed

An earlier draft had `Placement` carry a destination so model-facing keys
could land container-side. Checking rather than assuming: `githubsandbox`,
`gcpkey` and `geminikey` are the three capabilities that place anything and
**all three place `model.SideSandbox`**. `model.SideController` exists and
nothing produces one — `orchestrator/run.go:1832` skips it, "not written
anywhere".

`geminikey` looks like a counterexample and is not: it mints a key for a
task and names the path in the prompt so the *work* can find it.

So a placement has no side to choose, and a discriminator whose second
value has never occurred is not worth carrying across a versioned wire. The
agent's own credential is deployment-shaped rather than per-run and is not a
placement at all — it has no path the controller could name, which is
exactly what distinguishes it.

## Deadlines: the lease, declined

`GRAIN_MAX_RUNTIME` is enforced by the grain. The argument that survives is
spending: a running agent costs money, and money should not keep leaving
while a controller is down. (The argument that did not: "ends with a
`Result` rather than being destroyed mid-thought" — cancellation already
provides exactly that.)

What it does not cover: a controller dying five minutes into a two-hour
budget still leaves an hour fifty-five of spending. **A lease** — the grain
stopping if nobody has polled it in a while — bounds that under *any*
controller failure, and needs no policy in the grain at all ("nobody has
asked how I am doing" rather than "my deadline is 14:32").

**Declined** as more mechanism than the failure justifies, and with a
failure mode of its own: a controller restart longer than the lease would
kill healthy in-flight grains. **Worth revisiting if unattended controller
death turns out to be a real operational event rather than a hypothetical.**

## What the Spec shed

It began with a task, a repository, a branch, a git credential, a capability
grant list and three limits. All of it went, on one principle: a grain runs
an agent in a sandbox and knows nothing about why.

- **task, repo, branch** → the prompt and the setup script. A shim that
  understood repositories would have to agree with the controller about
  branch naming, proxy URLs and half-made checkouts.
- **gitToken** → a placement. The same work `ConfigureGitCredentials` does,
  said uniformly.
- **grants** → nothing. Both capabilities only ever made content readable —
  grain's own source, the embedded runbooks — and the sandbox image is built
  from that source and that binary, so what remains is a line in the prompt.
- **maxTurns** → a framework's own flag. `Config.MaxAgentTurns`' doc comment
  already concedes both frameworks default to no cap and "what actually
  bounds a runaway run is MaxRunRuntime".
- **maxRebuilds** → `Policy.MaxRebuilds` alone; the controller has the view
  of whether repair is converging.
- **id** → the container is the identity. A controller execs into one
  specific container, so a grain is never told a name it makes no use of.
- **the tool vocabulary** → the controller's own MCP server.
  `ToolOpenPullRequest` and friends were grain-the-product's names sitting
  inside grain-the-sandbox-runner; the mounted declarations that briefly
  replaced them went too (see "Forwarding calls, replaced by a real MCP
  connection").

### The two-phase start, retired

For a while the prompt was delivered by signal once the grain reported
`PhaseProvisioned`, because `previousAttemptsSection` names the commits
earlier attempts pushed and those were read from the checkout.

Retired once it was clear the controller can ask **GitHub** for a branch's
commits, which it already does every cycle. That deleted `PhaseProvisioned`,
`SignalPrompt`, `RunRow.PromptSent` and a reconcile row. What the two-phase
start was really protecting is untouched: `Setup`'s exit code still gates
starting the agent, so a failed checkout still spends no model tokens.

### The deferred category, retired

`comment_on_issue` and friends were to be answered locally with a canned
acknowledgement and reported at the end. The shim cannot know which tools
those are without understanding them — and forwarding them is better
anyway: the agent waits one tick and gets the real result instead of a
confirmation for an effect that happens later or not at all. Today's mocked
tools essentially lie to the agent; this stops.

## Versioning: what was taken from Kubernetes

`apiVersion` + `kind` on every object, forming the group/version/kind an API
server dispatches decoding on, with grade-carrying string versions.

**Taken: the string.** It lets a wire that is still a proposal say
`v1alpha1`, and it matches the comparison this needs — "refuse what you do
not recognise" is set membership, where an integer invites `>=`, which is
exactly the best-effort interpretation the rule forbids.

**Not taken: `kind`.** Kubernetes needs it because an API server decodes an
object without having been told what it asked for; here the subcommand is
the kind. The one channel carrying mixed documents is the trajectory
stream, where `src` already says which is which.

**Not taken: the group prefix, or per-kind versions.** A group routes
between vendors and there is one of those here; and Kubernetes versions per
kind because its kinds belong to different API groups on different release
cycles, where all of these ship in one binary.

**The `version` subcommand, retired** in favour of image labels. A
controller wants to know what an image can do *before* it creates a grain —
to refuse a task naming a framework the image lacks — and asking a grain
requires a grain to exist.

## The trajectory: from held-open exec to logs

An earlier draft gave the trajectory an exec held open for as long as
somebody watched. Container logs are better on four counts: the runtime
buffers, so a controller restarting mid-run resumes from `--since` rather
than losing what it missed; nothing backpressures the agent, where a
controller that stopped reading a held-open exec would eventually block the
shim's write and let an open UI tab stall a run; replay is the same call as
the tail; and wherever container logs are already collected, the trajectory
arrives with them.

Sharing the stream with the guest console makes tagged records mandatory —
`kubectl logs` merges stdout and stderr, so splitting by fd works under
docker and nowhere else — which turns the collision into something useful:
a run killed by the provisioning budget can quote the last console lines.

## Removing the status exec: what was checked

Once status was the only thing costing an exec per grain per tick, the
question was whether a native runtime path could carry it instead.

**Docker `HEALTHCHECK`** is the real candidate: the daemon runs a command
on its own schedule and `docker inspect` exposes `.State.Health.Log[]` with
each probe's exit code and output, so a healthcheck running `grain status`
would put the document where a plain inspect reads it, with the daemon
doing the exec. **Rejected**: docker-only, output capped at a few KB — which
a status carrying a call's arguments can approach — and a schedule fixed at
create rather than chosen by the shim.

**Kubernetes has no equivalent.** Probes are boolean; a probe's output
surfaces only in an Event, only on failure, truncated. Pod annotations
would need the container to call the API, which is push and needs a
credential. The termination message is terminal-only, and already taken.
That asymmetry decided it, the same way it decided the second-NIC option
for the network.

**What was taken instead: the log stream**, which works identically on both
and which the controller already tails. Status snapshots as `kind: "status"`
records make `List` exec-free in the steady state, stay level-triggered
because each is a full snapshot, and keep absence meaningful because
container state still comes from the runtime listing.

### And then the fallback went too

`grain status` survived the first pass as a fallback — one subcommand of a
binary that exists anyway, buying the ability to ask when a stream had
gone stale. Removed on a second look, because the honesty in the paragraph
that justified it was doing all the work:

- **It is not a second route where it matters.** On Kubernetes exec and
  logs both go through the API server and largely fail together. Under
  docker it is genuinely independent, so this is a fallback for one
  backend.
- **It cannot report the state it exists for.** The same shim answers, so
  a wedged one returns a stale document or hangs. "Container listed,
  nothing recent on the stream" already names that condition, and names it
  without waiting for a timeout.
- **It made the split inexact.** With two channels, `Health.Container` and
  `ID` could plausibly be filled by either. With one, they are definitively
  the backend's, filled from the listing — and now asserted
  (`TestAGrainReportsNeitherItsNameNorItsReachability`), because a grain
  reporting its own reachability states the fact its answering proved.

**What it costs**, stated plainly: after log rotation drops the last
status record, a controller waits up to one heartbeat to learn a phase
rather than asking. Bounded by a knob, which is a better home for that
tradeoff than a channel.

**What would reopen it**: a heartbeat slow enough that the wait hurts, or
a backend whose log stream is materially less reliable than its exec. Both
are measurable, and neither is true of docker or the kubelet today.

**What it bought** is larger than the deletion: with no call into a grain,
a grain has no inbound surface at all. Its input is environment and files
fixed at create; its output is stdout and the termination log. Nothing to
authenticate, nothing to version as an API, nothing that can hang — and
`Grains`/`Grain` becomes container-runtime operations end to end, with
zero methods that reach a shim.

## Letting the sandbox speak: how the guest sets `activity`

Needed because `activity`'s own example — "cloning acme/widgets" — is a
setup-time phrase, and setup runs before there is an agent to call the
`status` tool. Four ways for something in the guest to reach the shim:

1. **A sentinel line on stdout.** The shim already captures every guest
   command's output, so `echo "@grain:activity …"` needs no new path at
   all. **Rejected**: in-band signalling in a stream that also carries
   arbitrary build output, so any test that printed the sentinel would set
   the activity, and escaping it properly means a parser where a file
   would do.
2. **A reverse channel over vsock.** Clean, and an ask of kontur — whose
   ask list is already the blocking item. Rejected on cost, not on shape.
3. **The shim polls a guest file on its own schedule.** A poll into the
   guest, which is the thing the controller just stopped doing — though
   inside the container it is far cheaper, being a vsock hop rather than a
   docker or API-server one.
4. **A guest file, read on the round trip the shim already makes for
   `health.guest`.** *Chosen.* Option 3 without the extra call: the shim
   reads the guest on its heartbeat anyway, so this is one more path on an
   existing round trip, and the cadence is one already tuned.

**What it gives up** is latency and durability, both on purpose. An
activity set between heartbeats is not seen until the next one, and one
overwritten before a heartbeat is never seen at all. That is acceptable
because `activity` is a phrase for a human reading a task row and nothing
branches on it — `Reconcile` reads it only to copy it and to quote it in a
failure detail. A field anything decided on would not be allowed to work
this way.

**Not `/grain`.** The mounted tree is grain's own material, copied inward;
a guest-writable path inside it would let the sandbox appear to have
authored a prompt, a credential or a setup script. `/run/grain/activity`
keeps the two directions separate, and a test holds the line.

**Settled since**: the writer is a verb of the guest CLI rather than a
second binary, because the guest gets one CLI ("Three binaries, one per
trust zone" in `grain.md`). The objection that argued for two — the
controller verbs need a placed credential and an address, this needs
neither — becomes a constraint on that CLI instead: the credential is
per-verb, so `grain activity` runs in a deployment that configured no
controller verbs at all. The file stays the contract, so a setup script
with nothing but a shell can still `echo` into it.

## Can stdout and stderr be told apart?

**Docker: yes.** Each entry is tagged with its stream and the API can
return them separately. **Kubernetes: no.** The CRI log file format carries
the stream per line, but the pod log API returns only the message; a
node-local log agent could see it, nothing through the API server can.

So fd-splitting works under one backend and not the other, and the source
tag lives in the record instead. The discipline it *does* buy is worth
keeping regardless: **stdout is records only, stderr is the shim's
human-facing diagnostics** — otherwise a stray warning or panic trace is
indistinguishable from a damaged record.

This also corrected an earlier description. The guest console does not
share the stream raw: kontur is the shim's child, so its console output is
captured and re-emitted as `src: "console"` records. Wrapping is what makes
a console line addressable at all, which is what a `setup-failed` detail
quoting the last few lines depends on.

## Cancellation, and the signal verb that went with it

Cancelling was a `Signal` the grain was expected to act on, after which
the next poll would see a terminal phase and release it. **Killing the
container does the same thing in one tick**, because stopping a container
SIGTERMs the shim and waits out a grace period — so the graceful ending is
what killing already does, and kontur's own `ShutdownTimeout` plus
`terminationGracePeriodSeconds` already establish the pattern.

That took `SignalCancel` and `SignalPause` with it, leaving `addenda` as
the only signal — and `addenda` has no consumer.

### How addenda would reach an agent, if it ever did

Worth keeping, because the mechanism is not obvious and the analysis was
done. A comment added mid-run has to become a new user turn, and there are
three ways:

1. **Piggyback on the next tool result.** The shim intercepts every MCP
   call, so it can append a delimited note to the next result the agent
   receives. Works with *every* CLI, needs no capability from any of them,
   and arrives within seconds for an active agent. Out-of-band content on
   an in-band channel, which is a hack — but a well-understood one, and it
   crosses no new trust boundary, since that human's comments already
   reach the agent through the prompt.
2. **A built-in tool the agent calls** (`check_messages`). Universal, but
   depends on the agent choosing to call it, and one deep in a task often
   will not.
3. **Streaming stdin.** Semantically cleanest — a real user turn. `claude`
   supports it (`--input-format stream-json`, pairing with the
   `--output-format stream-json` already at `claude.go:574`); today the
   prompt goes in as `cmd.Stdin = strings.NewReader(stdin)`, which hits
   EOF immediately, so grain is one-shot by construction rather than by
   limitation. Unknown for `codex`, and unlikely for `agy`, which already
   lacks `--mcp-config` and `--max-turns`.

The shape would be (1) as the baseline with (3) as a per-framework
upgrade, which is exactly what the framework profile is for — it already
knows how to launch its CLI, so "and this one takes streaming input" is a
fact of the same kind.

**Not built**, because nothing consumes addenda today:
`agent.RunConfig.Addenda`'s own doc comment says neither framework calls
it, and a comment posted mid-run waits for the next dispatch. A verb for a
capability nobody uses is dead surface on a contract between two
separately released artifacts.

**Cheap to reverse.** A new subcommand is additive: an old shim returns
exit 2, which the controller already reads as version skew. Worth
revisiting if a run ever needs to hear something without being restarted —
and note it is *more* feasible in a grain than today, since the shim owns
both the agent's stdin and the MCP channel, where today the MCP server is
a forked subprocess on the controller and nothing owns stdin at all.

## What Kubernetes gives natively, and what it does not

Checked when asking whether any of this duplicates something k8s already
does.

**`.status.containerStatuses[]`** — `state`, `ready`, `restartCount`, and
for terminated ones `exitCode`/`reason`/`message`. This is what `List`
already reads; on docker it is `docker ps`/`docker inspect`, and the
information is the same.

**The termination message** is the one genuine addition: a container
writes `/dev/termination-log` and Kubernetes surfaces it in the pod
status, so a finished grain's outcome arrives with the listing rather than
needing an exec. Taken.

**Probes are the wrong tool.** They are binary, they exist for the kubelet
to act on rather than for an external reader, and liveness in particular
*restarts* — which a grain must never be. A readiness probe could surface
"provisioned" in the pod listing for free, letting `List` skip the exec for
still-provisioning grains; marginal, and recorded rather than built.

**What Kubernetes does not give** is mid-run rich state — activity, the
outstanding call, `seq`. There is no native "ask the container what it is
doing" short of exec, so the poll stays.

## How the agent reaches the controller: four designs, then none

Four designs, in the order they were built, each cutting the previous —
and then a fifth that deleted the question instead of answering it.

**1. Forwarding over a poll.** The shim held a tool call it could not
serve, surfaced it as `status.call`, and a `grain answer` verb settled it.
MCP over a poll. It re-implemented request/response over a channel not
built for it, and needed a spool, ids, acknowledgement and an
at-most-one-outstanding rule.

**2. Mounted tool declarations.** `/grain/tools/`, `ToolDecl` and
`checkTools`: the shim advertised the controller's tools from JSON files
placed beside it, so it could serve a `tools/list` before any controller
was connected. A second copy of every schema, to be kept in sync with the
server that actually implements it.

**3. An exec-attached MCP server.** The controller attached by exec'ing
`grain proxy` and served MCP over that pipe; the shim terminated the
agent's session, merged tool lists, and held calls while detached.

Better, but the failure mode shaped it and was not cheap. A shim that
merely piped bytes would lose the agent those tools **for the rest of the
run** on the first drop — MCP is session-oriented, a dead transport takes
the session with it, and clients generally mark such a server failed
rather than re-initializing. Terminating the session insulated against
that, at the cost of: a hold buffer, replayed calls on reattach (so
upstream servers had to tolerate seeing one twice), and a wait for the
first attach before the agent could start, because a tool list is fixed at
`initialize`.

**4. Streamable HTTP, direct.** The container has a working stack under
NAT, so the agent reached the controller's endpoint itself and the shim
took no part. MCP's remote transport already solved what design 3 was
hand-rolling — a session id keeps state across requests, and resumable SSE
(`Last-Event-ID`) replays what a client missed — so a drop became the
protocol's problem. That deleted `grain proxy`, `SocketUpstream`,
`Grain.Attach`, `Status.Upstream`, `ActionAttach`, the hold, the replay
hazard, the wait-for-first-attach rule and the merging server.

**5. A CLI in the guest.** *Chosen.* Nothing leaves the container at all.
The escape hatch is a binary in the guest with a credential placed
beside it, run with `run_command` like anything else the agent runs.

### Why the fifth won

Design 4 was defensible, and two things decided against it.

**It needed two transports, not one.** All three CLIs do remote MCP, but
not the same remote MCP: `claude` takes `--transport http` or `sse`,
`codex` has only `Stdio` and `StreamableHttp`
(`codex-rs/config/src/mcp_types.rs`), and `agy` has only SSE with
`serverUrl` (`docs/agy-surface.md`). No single transport covers all three,
so the controller would serve both — or bridge stdio in the shim for
whichever framework was left out, which is design 3 again for one case.

**It put a controller credential where the agent could read it.** Under
NAT the endpoint is reachable by the *guest* as well as the container, so
the design leaned on keeping the token root-owned at `/grain/token` with
the agent on a different uid, pointed at a loopback address a byte-proxy
in the shim forwarded from after adding the header. That is a real
mechanism — a uid split, a second listener, a header-rewriting proxy — and
it exists only because the agent and the thing it must not read share a
container.

The guest CLI has no such problem to solve, because grain already solved
it once. **A credential in the guest is not a new exposure**: git's token
is already there, because git runs there. What makes that safe is what
gets copied — `gitproxy.SandboxTokenStore.EnsureToken` mints per grain,
`Revoke` drops it at reap, and `model.Store.GitScope` resolves it to a
live run, with `authorize.go`'s fail-closed default that "a sandbox with
no live run authorizes nothing". A leaked credential dies with the run: no
expiry to tune, no revocation race. `startGitProxy` already binds
`0.0.0.0` and advertises a guest-reachable host, on **its own listener**,
separate from the daemon's REST API and UI. So the second service is the
same shape pointed somewhere else, not a second mechanism.

**Open item, and it is the real one.** Git's scope is repos. A controller
CLI needs its own answer to *what may this grain ask for* — open a pull
request on its own branch, comment on its own task, propose a task, ask
its own question. "Authenticated as this grain" is not "allowed to do
this", and that check is the controller's to write, modelled on
`authorize.go` rather than inherited from it.

### What was given up

**Per-tool schemas, again.** This is the message-tool design's cost
returning (below): a model given a declared tool with typed parameters
produces better-formed arguments than one given a CLI's `--help`. The
answer here is thinner than it looks — an agent CLI is a thing these
models are unusually good at driving, `--help` is a schema of a sort, and
a malformed invocation gets a non-zero exit and a message rather than
silently doing the wrong thing. But it is a real loss and worth naming.

**The one-sentence extension story.** Under design 4 it was: write a plain
MCP server, list it in the controller's config, and its tools appear to
every agent. Now it is: ship a binary into the guest, place a
credential, and mention it in the prompt or the setup script. Comparable
work, but the second one is not a standard anybody else implements.

**Discoverability.** An MCP client asks `tools/list` and learns what
exists. A CLI has to be *told about*, in the prompt or in `setup`, and an
agent never told is an agent that finishes without opening a pull request
and reports success — the "an absent tool is not an error" failure, moved
from the connection to the prompt.

### And the message-tool design, considered

Briefly: drop MCP entirely and give the agent one built-in that leaves a
message with an id, optional JSON and freeform text, then exits — the
controller reads it and decides what to do, retrying or parking by id. It
would have made a grain a single-shot function needing no controller at
all while it runs.

Rejected because it loses per-tool schemas and, more concretely, because
reacting to CI would cost a full redispatch — VM boot, clone,
re-derivation — where `open_pull_request` plus `wait_for_checks` do it
inside one run today, deliberately: "instead of exiting blind and leaving
the pull request to orchestrator's finish path."

Worth noting what survived it: the guest CLI keeps the in-run property the
message tool lost — `grain wait-for-checks` blocks in the guest and the
run continues after it — while keeping the message tool's best property,
that a grain needs no controller connection to run.

## Forwarding calls, and the connection that replaced it

Both are superseded by the guest CLI above; kept because the reasoning
about session-oriented transports is what ruled design 3 out and is worth
having written down.

For a while the controller was an out-of-band executor: the shim held a
tool call it could not serve, surfaced it as `status.call`, and a `grain
answer` verb settled it. **MCP over a poll.**

Replaced by the controller attaching an actual MCP server, because the
poll version was re-implementing request/response over a channel that was
not built for it. What that deleted: `Status.Call`, `Call`, `CallID`,
`Answer`, the "at most one outstanding" serialisation, `Status.Consumed`
and the spool, the `answer` verb, `ActionAnswer` — and `/grain/tools/`,
`ToolDecl` and `checkTools` with them, since a server advertises its own
`tools/list` and a mounted schema was only ever a second copy to keep in
sync.

### The failure mode that shaped it

The obvious version — the shim as a dumb byte pipe with a tee into the
trajectory — is wrong, and badly. MCP is session-oriented: a client
initializes once and a dead transport takes the session with it, and
clients generally mark such a server failed rather than re-initializing.
So a dropped pipe would cost the agent those tools **for the rest of the
run**, an hour in and silently, rather than for a tick.

Hence the shim terminates the agent's session and merges tool lists,
holding upstream calls while detached. The agent's connection is to the
shim, and the shim never closes it.

That recovers a small part of what forwarding was — an in-memory hold —
but not the expensive part: no spool, no status surfacing, no answer verb,
no ids to acknowledge.

### What it costs

**A grain cannot start without a controller.** A tool list is fixed at
`initialize`, so the shim must know the upstream tools before the agent
runs, which means waiting for the first attach. The alternative was
keeping mounted declarations so the shim is independent at start; waiting
was preferred because the controller has just created the grain (the
window is milliseconds), a grain that cannot reach a controller cannot do
its job anyway, and a controller dying before attach leaves the grain in
provisioning until `ProvisionBudget` — an ending that already has a rule.
A grain *does* survive a controller dying mid-run, on the cached list.

**At-least-once did not disappear, it moved.** A connection can drop after
an upstream server acted and before its answer arrived, so replaying a
held call can double-execute. That machinery moved from the wire into the
connection, where it is cheaper — in-memory, no `status.consumed` — but it
is not free. Naturally idempotent tools are better where achievable, and
grain's pull request path already is (`EnsurePullRequest`, find-or-create).

**Forwarding survived an absent controller and a connection does not.**
Under forwarding a grain blocked and was answered whenever *a* controller
returned, even a different process — the reattach property. Now calls
merely wait for the next tick's reattach, which is nearly the same thing,
but not identically so.

### What it bought

Real MCP, end to end, with immediate latency — `wait_for_checks` and
`ask_question` work by the server simply not answering yet, with no policy
in the wire. And an extension story that is one sentence: **write a plain
stdio MCP server, list it in the controller's config, and its tools appear
to every agent.** That server is unaware of the proxy, the container or
the VM; per-run context reaches it as launch arguments, because the
controller starts one instance per grain — which is how MCP servers are
scoped anyway.

Both properties were kept and paid for differently. `wait_for_checks`
still blocks in-run, as a guest command that has not returned. The
extension story is no longer one sentence of a public standard; it is a
binary in the guest and a placement, which is the trade the section above
accepts.
