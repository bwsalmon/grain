// The circle every per-task state badge opens with. Every state but one
// is the plain solid dot .badge::before already draws in CSS; a task
// that is actually running right now swaps it for the grain mark's
// glyph cycle instead -- the same "agents are working" signal the
// sidebar shows (Sidebar.jsx), now down at the row that is doing the
// work (bwsalmon/agents#586).
//
// 20px, well above the 11px .badge::before dot it replaces: the v2 mark
// is a filled region rather than a line figure, and under about 20px
// there are not enough pixels across the glyph for the four to be
// tellable apart. The task row is ~40px tall and its text line is
// ~20px, so this costs the row no height.
//
// live=false is for a badge recording a past "running" moment rather
// than the task's live status (Timeline's superseded entries) -- that
// one keeps the plain, non-spinning solid dot .badge-static draws, the
// same as every other historical state.
//
// repairing is a task whose run is the merge queue repairing its own
// pull request branch rather than writing the change in the first place
// (ui.Task.Repairing, model.Observation.MergeQueueRepairAt). It is
// running either way -- the same mark, moving the same way -- so what
// tells the two apart is the colour it moves in: green rather than the
// accent, .grain-mark-repair in style.css. A repair is the queue's own
// work on a change that is otherwise finished, and reading a row as
// "back to square one" when it is really being unstuck is exactly the
// misreading the second colour exists to prevent.
