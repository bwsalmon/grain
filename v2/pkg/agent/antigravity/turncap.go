// turnCap is the io.Writer Framework.Run splices into agy's live stdout
// to enforce RunConfig.MaxTurns. agy has no --max-turns flag to push the
// cap down into the binary (see this package's own doc comment), so the
// cap is counted here instead, off the same stream-json events the
// transcript is built from: every completed agent_response step is one
// turn, and reaching max cancels the run's context, which
// procgroup.Prepare turns into a kill of agy and its MCP child both.
//
// Counting on the live stream rather than on the finished capture is the
// whole point -- a cap applied after the process exits would report a
// runaway run without ever having stopped one.
//
// Writes arrive as arbitrary byte chunks, not whole lines: exec.Cmd
// copies whatever it reads from the pipe. A partial trailing line is
// therefore held in buf and completed by a later write, rather than being
// parsed (and miscounted, or dropped) as if it were whole.
