// noteOrphanedPullRequests says, on a closed task and on each pull
// request still linked to it, that grain has stopped watching it.
//
// This is the run-side half of the telling model.OrphanedPullRequestNote
// describes; ui.Client.noteOrphanedPullRequests is the other, for a close
// arriving from a human rather than discovered by a finishing run. Both
// exist because either one can be first: a close that lands while a run
// is still live is read here, at the finish, on a link the human's own
// close could not yet see, and a close that lands afterwards is read
// there, on a link this run has already written. Whichever runs second
// finds the note already there and says nothing more (Store.
// OrphanedPullRequestNoted).
//
// The task is re-read rather than taken from the caller's copy for the
// same reason taskClosed re-reads the observation: that copy was read at
// the top of the cycle, before the run that just finished had opened --
// and linked -- its own pull request through open_pull_request, which is
// precisely the case this exists for.
//
// A failed GitHub call is not a failed note. It is folded into the words
// left on the task (the echo argument), so the record survives a
// credential that cannot comment, and logged, because this package has a
// journal to log it to and a note nobody read is worth a line in it.
