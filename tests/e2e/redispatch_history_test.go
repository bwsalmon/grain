// TestARedispatchIsToldWhatTheAttemptBeforeItDid drives two real
// orchestrator.RunDispatch calls at the same task, with a real gitproxy
// in front of a real bare upstream repo, and reads the prompt the second
// one was actually given out of the store. The first attempt pushes a
// commit and its run row is finished with an outcome; the second has to
// open on a checkout of that branch and a prompt that says both what
// happened and what is on it.
//
// Why it matters: a redispatch used to get the task, the conversation,
// its attachments and a checkout continuing the previous attempt's
// branch -- and no account whatever of the attempt that made those
// commits (docs/agent-ergonomics.md, finding 8). The cheapest thing that
// cost was re-doing a diagnosis grain had already paid for; the dearest
// was re-attempting exactly the thing that ran out of wall clock. Both
// halves of the fix need the two things only a real dispatch has
// together: the store's own task_run rows, and a checkout to read
// `git log` out of.
