// - PassFailed: at least one task in the pass failed or closed without
// completing -- the run stops here, SuiteRunFailed.
// - PassClean or PassChanged: every task in the pass completed. A
// SuiteCount run fires another pass until it has run Count of them,
// then stops, succeeded, whatever any pass produced. A SuiteUntilClean
// run stops the moment a pass is PassClean (bwsalmon/agents#642's own
// "run the tasks until they generate no issues or repo changes"), or
// fires another pass, up to MaxPasses -- reaching MaxPasses without
// ever seeing a clean pass is reported as SuiteRunFailed, not silently
// accepted, so a suite that never converges is visible rather than
// looking the same as one that succeeded on its very last allowed pass.
