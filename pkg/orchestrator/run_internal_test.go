// The question these exist for is not "is the sentence nicely worded".
// It is whether a deployment can answer, from its own store, whether a
// tool it built and named in the prompt is being called at all -- see
// outcomeOf's own doc comment. agent.Result is never persisted and
// Result.Transcript is optional prose, so task_run.detail is the whole
// record, and a successful run used to leave it blank.

// The successful ending is the one that matters most here: a run that
// pushed, read CI, repaired and pushed again is a run that succeeds, so
// the path that recorded nothing was exactly the path worth measuring.
