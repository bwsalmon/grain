// The live daemon tests' own pacing helpers, checked without a live key.
//
// They need their own coverage precisely because of what they are for:
// liveDaemonContext, awaitFinishedRun and pollUntil exist to keep
// daemon_live_test.go and daemon_true_e2e_test.go from failing on the
// clock, and both of those skip everywhere GEMINI_API_KEY is unset --
// including CI. A helper whose only exercise is a test that never runs
// is a helper nobody finds out is broken until the next person spends a
// live credential on it, which is the same "an assertion nothing ever
// runs" problem the fixed windows they replaced had.
//
// What is checked here is the arithmetic and the wording, which is all
// of these helpers that does not need an agent: that the daemon's own
// context really does outlive the wait for its run by the window grain's
// finishing needs, that a finished row ends the wait and an unfinished
// one does not, and that the message a spent budget produces names the
// clock rather than leaving a reader to suspect the daemon.
