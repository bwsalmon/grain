// The instrument TestLiveNativeToolsAreDenied uses to see the PreToolUse
// payloads a live agy actually sends, and the test that keeps that
// instrument honest.
//
// # Why a wrapper binary, and what it is for
//
// agy hands each hook `{"toolCall": {"name": ..., "args": ...}}` on stdin
// and reads a decision back, and antigravity.HookDecision matches that
// name against the tools grain withholds. Everything about that denial
// rests on the name arriving in the spelling the deny list is written in
// -- and the shape is not obvious from agy's own documentation, which
// says matchers match *step types* ("lowercasing the step type and
// removing the CORTEX_STEP_TYPE_ prefix"). If a name arrives in a shape
// HookDecision does not recognise, the deny list denies nothing, quietly,
// and the only symptom is a native tool that runs.
//
// A transcript cannot answer this: it reports the tool agy ran, not the
// name it asked the hook about. So the live test points agy's config at
// this wrapper instead of at grain itself. It is grain in every respect
// -- for anything but the hook subcommand it replaces itself with the
// real binary, so the forked MCP server agy spawns is the same process it
// would otherwise have been -- and for the hook it records the payload
// before handing it to the same grain, unchanged, and passes grain's own
// reply back on stdout.
//
// It exits 0 whatever happens, like the subcommand it stands in front of:
// measured against agy 1.1.26, a hook that exits non-zero fails the tool
// call outright, so an instrument that failed loudly would break the very
// runs it is watching.
//
// # Why this file also holds a test of the wrapper
//
// The wrapper only ever runs on the nightly, where a mistake in it looks
// exactly like the regression the nightly exists to catch: grain's tools
// unable to reach the sandbox, or a hook that denies nothing. The test
// below drives it directly -- no agy, no credential -- so a broken
// instrument fails in the pull-request suite, where the person who broke
// it is looking.
