// Compute, against timelines built by hand. Every case here is one the
// store can really produce -- a task approved in the instant it was
// filed, a run that failed before its agent started, an attempt still in
// flight when the report was taken -- since the point of the package is
// that it reports what happened rather than what a well-formed record
// would have looked like.
