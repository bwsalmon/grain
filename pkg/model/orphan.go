// An orphaned pull request is one grain has stopped watching: its task
// was closed while the pull request was still open, so nothing here will
// ever merge it, sync it or read it again.
//
// That is a deliberate outcome, not a bug -- nobody wants a closed task's
// work merged, and the commits on the branch are real work whichever way
// the human went on the task. What was missing was anybody being *told*.
// The pull request sits open on GitHub with no sign that grain has looked
// away, and the task it belongs to is closed, so nobody is reading there
// either; a human who closes a task does not necessarily know they have
// just orphaned a pull request.
//
// The note below is that telling, and it is said in both places, because
// they are two different readers rather than the same one twice: on the
// task, for whoever just closed it, and on the pull request itself, for
// whoever finds it open weeks later and has no reason to look at a closed
// task at all. Store.NoteOrphanedPullRequest writes the task's copy;
// posting the other copy needs a GitHub client, so it belongs to the
// callers that have one (pkg/orchestrator on the finish path,
// cmd/grain/daemon.go's adapter for a close arriving over the UI/API).
//
// Leaving it open is not the only ending any more: a human closing a task
// can ask, in the same breath, for its pull request to be closed too
// (ui.CloseOptions.ClosePullRequest, a checkbox beside the Close button).
// That is the one thing in grain that throws work away on GitHub, so it
// happens only on that explicit ask, never by grain's own decision -- and
// when it does happen, the same two readers are told the same way, in the
// second form of the words below.

// PullRequestCloseOutcome is what grain did to the pull request itself
// when its task was closed, and it is what picks the note's words.
//
// The zero value -- nobody asked, so nothing was done -- is the ordinary
// case and the only one pkg/orchestrator's finish path ever has: a run
// discovering that its task was closed underneath it has no human in
// front of it to have asked for anything.

	// nobody had asked, and the refusal is said in the note rather than
	// returned to the caller.

// and not refused. The two fields are kept apart rather than collapsed

// itself: nil means it landed, non-nil means it did not and says why.
// Folding that into the words rather than dropping it is what keeps a
// failed GitHub call from costing a close its record -- the task's own
// copy is written last, after the attempt, and a deployment whose UI is
// not wired to a GitHub client at all is one legitimate reason for a
// non-nil echo, not an error worth failing a close over.

// on the pull request is this same text without the echo line, so a
