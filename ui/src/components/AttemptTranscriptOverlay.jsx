// running, the backend serves whatever its framework has mirrored to a
// live transcript file so far (ui.Config.LiveTranscripts,
// bwsalmon/agents#467), so each poll here genuinely picks up new content
// rather than re-reading an empty row until the attempt finishes. Leaving

// long-running agent" (bwsalmon/agents#446) means in practice.
