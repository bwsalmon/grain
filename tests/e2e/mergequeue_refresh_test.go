// The end-to-end half of docs/merge-queue-staleness.md: a queue head
// whose CI last ran against a base that has since moved is brought up to
// date by the queue itself, with no agent run and no fix task, and merges
// once CI has answered about the tree that would actually land. This is
// the test that would have covered every commit that document lists --
// each of them an agent dispatched into a sandbox to type `git merge
// origin/main`.
//
// Its companion is the case that write cannot fix: a branch that
// genuinely conflicts with its base, where the fix task is still filed --
// and now says the merge queue tried the merge and watched it fail, which
// is a different job from the one an agent was previously handed.
//
// Both run against githubsim over the same real bare repository the rest
// of this package uses, so "behind", "up to date" and "conflicts" are
// answered by real git: the whole reason the queue asks GitHub to make
// the merge is that its answer is authoritative.
