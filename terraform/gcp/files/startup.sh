# GCE startup script. Runs as root on every boot, and must be idempotent.
#
# Mirrors v1's own startup script's shape exactly: mount the
# disks, install and enable config-sync, and nothing else. All the
# real work is in deploy.sh, which config-sync fetches from instance
# metadata so it can change without recreating the instance.
#
# Two disks, for two different reasons:
#
#   grain-data     /var/lib/grain, the state a redeploy must not lose
#                  (the SQLite store, the secrets database). Small, and
#                  carries prevent_destroy in instance.tf.
#   grain-sandbox  /mnt/grain-sandbox, everything a *sandbox* writes:
#                  docker's data root (the sandbox image and the qcow2
#                  overlay each kontur VM's container writes its root
#                  filesystem into) and HostSandboxes' per-run checkouts.
#                  Nothing here is worth keeping; the point is that the
#                  disk a runaway task fills is not the one the OS, the
#                  journal, the store and the deploy itself need to write
#                  to. See variables.tf's own sandbox_disk_gb.
