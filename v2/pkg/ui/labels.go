// Package ui is a JSON API (and the static frontend it serves) for
// creating and managing grain tasks and their capability grants.
//
// It reads and writes model.Store directly. That is the whole of the
// change bwsalmon's "the input is via direct model updates" asked for:
// this package used to read and write GitHub issues, deriving a task's
// state from labels and keeping its declared fields (/repo, /base,
// /auto-merge) as directive lines in an issue body, because the
// store-backed intake path was not wired into anything that ran. GitHub
// was the record and this was a view onto it.
//
// Now the store is the record. A task is a row, its state comes from
// model.StateOf's own view rather than a second label-shaped derivation
// that had already drifted (this package used to call the same state
// "needs_approval" that the store calls "proposed", and had an
// "untracked" the store has no notion of), its capabilities are
// model.Grants, and its conversation is model.Comments. Nothing here
// talks to GitHub at all: the pull request a task's run produces is
// recorded on the task as a model.LinkFixes link, so rendering it needs
// no API call.
