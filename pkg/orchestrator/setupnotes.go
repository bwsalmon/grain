// setupNotes is grain narrating the one stretch of a run that no agent is
// driving: everything between dispatch.Cycle making the run durable and
// framework.Run taking its first turn -- a sandbox acquired (a kontur VM
// boot, minutes of it), a repo cloned, the repo's setup command run,
// capability credentials minted.
//
// task_run.activity was written only by the run's own update_status tool
// (ui.Client.SetTaskActivity, mcp.NewStatusTools), so a task that had
// just been dispatched read 'running' with nothing beside it for exactly
// the part of its life where "what is it doing?" has a precise answer --
// and the precise answer is one grain is holding, since there is no agent
// yet to hold it. These phrases are that answer, put where a person is
// already looking (ui.Task.Activity, on the task list and the task page).
//
// They go through the same model.Store.SetTaskActivity write the tool
// reaches, so there is no second column, no second read and no second
// renderer: a setup phrase is shown by everything that already shows a
// run's own.
//
// Whose words they are is not left to the phrasing, and not left to a
// prefix an agent could type for itself either. A note is grain's exactly
// while task_run.agent_started_at is unset, and handOver clears the last
// one in the same breath as Store.SetRunAgentStarted -- so the row itself
// carries the distinction (model.RunActivity.BySetup), and the UI marks
// such a phrase as grain's rather than passing it off as something the
// run said.
//
// The zero value is a working no-op, which is what the recreate path
// passes: see restoreCheckout.

// applied here instead -- every phrase below is short by construction,
// but a repository with a very long name is not this package's to
// promise anything about. setup_notes_test.go holds the two numbers
