# --- the state bucket --------------------------------------------------
#
# `terraform init` against a bucket that does not exist fails with
# "Failed to get existing workspaces: querying Cloud Storage failed:
# storage: bucket doesn't exist", which says nothing about what to do.
# A first deploy of a new deployment hits it every time: bootstrap-gcp.sh
# creates the bucket, and until someone has run it there is nothing to
# init against.
#
# So create it here when it is missing, with the same three protections
# bootstrap-gcp.sh applies -- uniform bucket-level access, versioning,
# public access prevention. Versioning is the one that matters most: it
# is what makes a corrupted or truncated state file recoverable, and a
# bucket created without it cannot be fixed retroactively for the state
# it has already lost.
#
# This needs storage.buckets.create on the project, which the deployer
# holds via roles/storage.admin (bootstrap-gcp.sh grants it). Its other
# storage grants are scoped to the bucket itself and so cannot help
# create one.
#
# Only ever creates the name this deployment's own config already
# derives -- see the guard below on why it will not create an arbitrary
# one.

  # the apply would set about building a second copy of the deployment
  # alongside the real one. Before this step existed, the same typo
  # simply failed init and someone noticed.
  #
  # So only the name bootstrap-gcp.sh itself would have chosen is created
  # here -- "<project_id>-<name_prefix>-tfstate", both read from this
  # deployment's own tfvars. Anything else is a name a human chose
  # deliberately (bootstrap's own --bucket), and creating it is theirs to

# GCP stock-outs (ZONE_RESOURCE_POOL_EXHAUSTED and its siblings) are a
# common, transient failure creating a VM or disk in a given zone -- a
# plain retry a few minutes later routinely succeeds once the zone frees
# up capacity, so back off and retry instead of failing the whole
# rollout. Any other failure still fails immediately: retrying a bad
# config or a real quota limit only burns the backoff budget.
#
# google_compute_instance.host's own metadata update (grain-deploy-generation,
# every apply that changes anything in grain_config -- see instance.tf) is a
# second source of a transient, retry-worthy failure, and not a GCP stock-out
# at all: the google provider retries that update itself, to absorb a 412
# where another update raced it for the instance's metadata fingerprint, but
# hardcodes the *whole* retry -- GET the instance, POST the new metadata, wait
# for the resulting operation to finish -- to a one-minute budget it never
# derives from this resource's own `timeouts` (confirmed in the pinned
# hashicorp/google ~> 6.8 provider's resourceComputeInstanceUpdate, which
# calls transport_tpg.Retry with no Timeout set, so transport_tpg.Retry's own
# default of 1*time.Minute applies regardless of how long a real update is
# allowed to take). Ordinary GCP latency can eat that minute with no fault of
# ours, and the provider then reports exactly "Error: timeout while waiting
# for state to become 'success' (timeout: 1m0s)" and abandons an update that
# was very likely about to succeed. A plain retry of the whole `terraform
# apply` is safe here the same way it is for a stock-out: this resource's
# state was never advanced, so the next attempt just retries the same
# SetMetadata call. See bwsalmon/agents#636.

# Terraform renders a *replaced* resource's prior state in full, and
# instance.tf's own lifecycle.ignore_changes does not suppress any of it:
# that block keeps push-secrets.sh's metadata out of an in-place diff, not
# out of the state a destroy is rendered from. Refresh reads the
# instance's real metadata back on every run, so any apply that replaces
# the host -- a bigger boot_disk_gb, a new boot_image or machine_type,
# each of which forces replacement -- prints every secret sitting on it,
# the minter account's private key included, into a log everyone who can
# read the workflow run can read (bwsalmon/agents#653, where exactly that
# happened). GitHub Actions masks the values a workflow handed it as
# secrets; it cannot mask the minter key, which push-secrets.sh mints
# during the run.
#
# So the apply is filtered before it reaches the log or "$out": PEM
# private-key bodies go, and so do the values of the metadata keys
# push-secrets.sh writes. Redacting rather than silencing the apply
# altogether, because this log is the first real plan a deployment ever
# gets -- a config repo's plan.yml runs unauthenticated on purpose -- so
# which resource changed, which attribute, and that it was replaced all
# have to survive. Ordinary applies print none of this anyway
# (ignore_changes covers them); this is the replacement case.
#
# Keyed on the metadata names rather than on the values, because the
# values are exactly what this script must never be trusted to have seen.
# The identifiers around them stay: private_key_id in particular names
# which key to revoke if one did leak before this existed.
