// TestMain gives the kernel-touching tests in this package a network
// namespace to themselves.
//
// They create real veths, taps, bridges and tc filters. Doing that in the
// namespace they inherit -- a CI runner's, or a developer's own -- means
// sharing it with everything else that reacts to an interface appearing:
// systemd-networkd, udev, NetworkManager and docker all watch for new
// links and will address, rename or enslave one out from under a test.
// It also means a test that dies without running its cleanup leaves
// interfaces behind on a machine somebody else is using, and that every
// name has to be made unique by hand in case two runs overlap.
//
// A namespace of our own removes all three problems at once: nothing else
// is in it, the names can be fixed and readable, and the whole namespace
// (and every interface in it) is destroyed by the kernel when the process
// holding it exits, cleanup or no cleanup.
//
// It is taken by re-executing this same test binary as a child with
// CLONE_NEWNET, rather than by calling unshare(2) here. A network
// namespace in Linux is a property of a *thread*, and the Go runtime
// moves goroutines between threads freely and keeps threads it created
// before now -- so unsharing on this one would leave the tests running on
// whichever thread the scheduler picked, some in the new namespace and
// some in the old, which is a worse kind of flakiness than the one this
// is fixing. A forked child starts with one thread in the new namespace
// and every thread it goes on to create inherits it, so there is no
// per-thread discipline to get wrong.
