# Three service accounts, mirroring terraform/gcp/iam.tf's shape for v1
# but retargeted at v2's own pkg/gcpsetup naming and capability surface:
#
#   host   -- what the VM itself runs as. Holds no secret grant of its
#             own; its two runtime credentials (the GitHub PAT, and --
#             if minted -- the minter's key) arrive as instance
#             metadata, pushed there by push-secrets.sh, never through
#             Terraform.
#   agent  -- the narrow account pkg/capability/gcpkey mints per-task
#             keys for, and the account this module's own
#             agent_can_manage_compute_instances/agent_can_manage_gke
#             grant against. Named agent_account_id, defaulting to
#             pkg/gcpsetup.DefaultAgentAccountID so a deployment running
#             `grain daemon -gcp-agent-service-account
#             <this account's email>` (which deploy.sh always passes
#             explicitly regardless) needs no coincidence to work.
#   minter -- mints and revokes the agent account's keys
#             (pkg/capability/gcpkey.Provider's own MinterCredential),
#             and -- with enable_gemini_key -- administers API keys
#             project-wide for pkg/capability/geminikey. Its own key
#             never touches Terraform state; see variables.tf's
#             deployer_member and push-secrets.sh.
#
# v1's iam.tf additionally has the controller *impersonate* its agent
# account (host_impersonates_agent) rather than hold a standing key for
# it -- v2 has no equivalent yet (pkg/capability/gcpkey authenticates as
# the minter using its own key file, not impersonation), so this module
# does not attempt to build that half; see this module's README, "What
# this does not have yet."
