// listOrder.js is a display order for the list pages that have no
// backlog of their own -- repos, templates, schedules, suites
// (grain/task-327).
//
// # Why these lists get an order at all
//
// The task list is dragged into the order somebody wants to work in, and
// that order is real: it is the backlog the dispatcher actually reads
// (Store.Reorder, bwsalmon/agents#476), so a row carries a drag handle
// and moving it changes what runs next. None of the other four lists has
// anything like that -- a repo is not dispatched against another repo,
// and a schedule fires on its own clock -- so they were left with no
// manual order, no handle, and rows that read as flatter and blanker
// than the task rows beside them for no reason a reader can see.
//
// The order here is exactly what it looks like: where a row sits on the
// page, and nothing else. Dragging a repo to the top does not make it
// more important to the daemon; it makes it the first row, for the
// person who dragged it, the way pinning a tab does. That is worth
// having on its own -- the four repos somebody actually watches sit at
// the top instead of wherever the alphabet put them -- and it is why
// this is browser state rather than an API call.
//
// # Where it is kept
//
// localStorage, one key per list, the same treatment the board's columns
// and the theme mode get (board.js, ThemeModeContext.jsx) and for the
// same reason: it is how one person wants to look at the deployment, not
// a fact about the deployment. Nothing behind /api/config changes when a
// row moves, and two people looking at one grain are each allowed their
// own order.
//
// Anything unreadable -- a half-written value, a shape from some other
// build, localStorage denied outright by the browser -- is treated as
// "no order stored yet" rather than as an error to show somebody: the
// list still renders, in its own default order, and the next drag
// overwrites the bad value.
//
// # What a stored order does *not* have to be
//
// It is a list of ids, and neither side of it is required to match the
// items on screen. Ids that are gone (a deleted template) are ignored;
// items the stored order has never heard of (a repo added this morning)
// sort after every item it does name, in whatever order the list's own
// fallback comparator puts them -- so a new arrival appears at the
// bottom, predictably, instead of being silently dropped or jumping into
// the middle. Nothing is ever rewritten to prune the stale ids: the next
// drag stores the order as it is displayed, which prunes them anyway.

// dragging one would throw away the position of everything else.
