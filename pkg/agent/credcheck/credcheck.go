// Package credcheck tests an agent framework's own credential against
// the service that issued it: one cheap, harmless call, authenticated
// exactly as a dispatch would authenticate, reported as a sentence a
// human can act on.
//
// It is the agent-credential half of what model.CredentialChecker does
// for capabilities (pkg/ui/capability_check.go, README.md's "Testing a
// credential, from the pane that calls it Ready"). Settings' Agents tab
// could already say whether a framework's credential is *set* -- the
// secret exists and resolves -- and that is the whole of what a pane
// reading grain's own store can see. A revoked Gemini key, a Claude
// OAuth token whose session was ended, an OpenAI key deleted in somebody
// else's console: every one of those leaves the chip reading "set", and
// the first thing that notices is a dispatched run failing to
// authenticate several minutes into somebody's task.
//
// This package is what turns that into a question askable before a run:
// list the models the credential can see. A listing is the cheapest
// authenticated call each of these three APIs has, it creates nothing, it
// spends no tokens, and it is safe to press twice -- the same rules the
// capability checks hold to, and for the same reason: this is a button.
//
// Deliberately not in the three framework packages themselves. What is
// being checked is the *credential*, not the CLI: the binary need not be
// installed, no subprocess is forked, and an operator pasting a key into
// Settings on a host whose `agy` is missing still gets a straight answer
// about the key. Running each CLI instead would have cost a real model
// call per press and answered two questions at once, which is the shape
// of test that leaves nobody knowing which half failed.
