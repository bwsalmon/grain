package githubtoken

// The credential check for one named GitHub token (grain/task-189), and
// the two questions its design turned on.
//
// **Why this capability gets a check at all.** Settings reports every
// named-token row **Ready** by construction -- a row exists because an
// operator's own file under secrets/github exists, and there is no
// deployment setting and no secrets-store entry either could be waiting
// on (ui.githubTokenStatuses). That is an honest answer to "is this
// deployment configured for it" and no answer at all to the way these
// credentials actually fail: a token revoked, expired or rotated at
// GitHub's end, or one whose access to a repo was taken away. Nothing
// in the file changes when that happens, so every pane goes on saying
// Ready and the first symptom is a push failing through the git proxy,
// mid-run, as a sandbox's own error.
//
// **What it authenticates with, given this provider holds no client.**
// A named token is a SELECT capability: it mints nothing, places
// nothing, and during a dispatch resolves no credential at all -- the
// proxy looks the material up per request (githubtoken.go's own doc
// comment). So the check cannot reuse a client the provider already
// has, because there is none. It does not grow its own way to *find*
// the material either: Config.Credentials is the credential ladder
// itself (gitproxy.CredentialSet behind cmd/grain/daemon.go's adapter),
// which is the one thing that already knows both forms a named
// credential comes in -- a <name>.token read as-is, or a <name>.app.json
// whose installation token it mints and re-mints. Handing the check the
// ladder rather than teaching it to read files is what keeps "what does
// this token authenticate as" answered in exactly one place, and it is
// what makes the check test the material a push would actually carry,
// App re-minting included.
//
// model.CredentialResolver -- the secrets store every other
// CheckCredential resolves through -- is deliberately unused here for
// the same reason Spec().Requires is empty: these credentials are files,
// not secrets-store rows, and pkg/gitproxy/credentials.go records at
// length why they stay that way.
//
// **Why /rate_limit, and then the repos.** GET /rate_limit is the
// cheapest live-or-dead answer GitHub gives: it costs nothing against
// the limit it reports, and unlike GET /user it is answerable by both
// forms of credential (an App installation token has no user, and
// answers /user with a 403). But "the token is alive" is rarely the
// interesting failure. A token that is alive and has lost access to the
// repo it exists to push to fails in exactly the same place a dead one
// does, so the check goes on to look up each repo this deployment
// targets and reports, per repo, whether the token can see it and
// whether it could push to it.
//
// Repo access is reported as evidence, not folded into the verdict,
// with one exception. A named token is deliberately narrower than the
// deployment default -- that is what it is for -- so a token that
// cannot reach some target repo is doing its job, and failing the check
// for it would paint a correctly-scoped token permanently red. A token
// that can reach *none* of them is the other thing: live, and useless
// for anything any task on this deployment could ask it to do, which is
// a refusal an operator wants to hear about in the same words as a dead
// token.
