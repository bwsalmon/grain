// CycleTimes is how long this daemon's own RunCycle ticks have been
// taking: a fixed-size ring of the most recent cycles, written by
// RunCycle and read by whatever wants to report them (pkg/ui's
// GET /api/metrics, through cmd/grain's own adapter).
//
// **Why this is in memory rather than in the store.** Everything else
// grain measures is derived from rows that already exist -- pkg/metrics'
// own "nothing here is stored", and docs/data-model.md's "anything
// derivable is derived, never stored" behind it. A tick is the one thing
// that leaves no row at all: it reads the store, decides, and returns,
// so there is nothing to derive its duration from afterwards. That left
// two options, and this is the second:
//
//   - a row per cycle. Durable across restarts, and queryable over any
//     window a report asks for. It costs a new table, a write on every
//     single tick forever (2,880 a day at the default 30s
//     -poll-interval), and a growth curve nothing prunes -- to measure
//     something whose whole purpose is to say whether *this process,
//     right now* is dispatching promptly. It would also make the
//     measurement change what it measures: a tick that writes a row is a
//     tick with a store write in it.
//   - a ring in the process. Bounded memory, no schema, no write, and
//     nothing stored -- which keeps the doctrine above intact rather than
//     carving an exception into it. It is lost on restart, and that is
//     the honest cost: tick history belongs to the process that produced
//     it, and a daemon that has just restarted has a fresh tick anyway,
//     with none of the accumulated store the slow tick this exists to
//     catch would have been slow because of.
//
// The question this answers is "is the tick itself the reason tasks are
// waiting?", which is a question about now. A week of tick history would
// not answer it better; it would only cost a table.
//
// A CycleTimes is safe for concurrent use. Its zero value works -- the
// ring is allocated on first write -- so a test can use new(CycleTimes)
// without a constructor.

	// approved just after one cycle's dispatch decision waits a
	// -poll-interval plus this before the next one reaches it.
