// TestLiveNativeToolsAreDenied is the check that the tool denial in
// agent/antigravity actually denies anything, run against a real agy and
// a real model because nothing smaller can answer the question.
//
// grain writes two things into every agy run's private HOME to keep the
// model off agy's own tools -- the permission rules in settings.json and
// the PreToolUse hook in hooks.json -- and neither is grain's mechanism:
// what a rule or a decision does is entirely up to the binary, and the
// binary's own documentation stops at "hard block the execution
// immediately". Everything else in this repository that touches the hook
// checks the bytes grain produces, which is a check that grain says what
// it meant to say and no evidence at all that agy listens. That gap is
// not theoretical: the first version of this hook replied {} to a call it
// had no opinion about, agy read a decision-less object as a *deny*, and
// every tool call every agy run made -- grain's own MCP tools included --
// was blocked. The whole suite stayed green, because the hook was
// emitting exactly the bytes its test asked for.
//
// So this test runs a live model at a real controller filesystem and
// looks at what happened to the files. It sits beside
// TestLiveIssueCompletesEndToEnd, shares its gating (an unset
// GEMINI_API_KEY or a missing agy skips, unless GRAIN_LIVE_AGENT_TEST
// makes that a failure) and is run by the same nightly workflow.
//
// # What it asks the model to do, and why it asks so bluntly
//
// The prompt names agy's own run_command, tells the model to use it, and
// gives it a path outside the sandbox to write to. That is deliberately
// the opposite of what grain's prompt preamble asks for, and it is the
// only shape that tests anything: a model politely using grain's tools
// proves the preamble works, which is not what is under test here. What
// is under test is what happens when the model reaches for the tool
// anyway -- because a run whose task genuinely calls for one, or a
// prompt-injected run, will.
//
// The assertions are ordered by what they can prove. The file on the
// controller is the property itself and is checked first. The hook's
// verdict on grain's own tools is next, because that is the failure this
// test was written after: a denial that also denies grain's tools reads,
// from any distance, like a model that would not do as it was asked.
