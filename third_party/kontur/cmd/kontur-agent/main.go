// Command kontur-agent runs inside the guest and answers "kontur exec".
//
// It listens on a virtio-vsock port and hands each connection to
// internal/agent, which runs one command and streams it back
// (internal/execwire). This is what replaced running an sshd in the
// guest purely so that kontur had a way in: the guest no longer needs a
// network service, a host keypair, an authorized key or an account to
// log into, and "kontur exec" no longer needs the guest to have finished
// bringing up a control network before it can work.
//
// vsock rather than a socket on the control link, because the point is
// to stop depending on guest networking at all. A vsock connection is
// carried by the virtio device itself: it works before the guest has an
// address, while its network is misconfigured, and with no NIC attached
// at all -- states in which the SSH transport left a running, healthy
// guest unreachable and unexplained. Under cloud-hypervisor the host
// side is a unix socket in the VM's own container rather than anything
// on a network, which is also why this needs no authentication of its
// own; internal/execwire's package comment sets out that reasoning.
//
// It is deliberately not a systemd socket-activated service. Activation
// would put systemd's socket handling between the hypervisor and this,
// and the failure it protects against -- an agent that died -- is one
// Restart=always already covers, without the guest needing a systemd new
// enough to have vsock socket units.
