package staterepo

// workflow_history.go holds the renderings of the CI workflow that
// earlier grains wrote, so that a file one of them installed is still
// recognisable as grain's own text rather than as somebody's.
//
// RenderedImage decides what grain may touch by byte equality with a
// template, which is the only test that can tell an operator's runner,
// trigger or added step from grain's own file without deciding what a
// workflow is allowed to say. The cost of that test is that it is a
// test against *this build's* template: edit one comment in it and every
// file grain has already installed stops being recognised, keeps
// whatever image it was installed with, and is never maintained again --
// which is not a broken deployment, but it is a deployment the next fix
// to this file does not reach without somebody running
// `grain state ci -force` on it by hand.
//
// So the templates grain has rendered before are kept here, and a file
// that matches one of them word for word is adopted: grain rewrites it
// to this build's template, once, and maintains its image line from then
// on. Nothing is loosened by this -- each entry is still an exact match
// against text grain itself wrote, and a file with one character of
// anybody else's in it matches none of them.
//
// The rule for editing the template in format.go: add its previous text
// here, unchanged, as a new entry. TestTheCurrentTemplateIsRecorded
// fails until you do, because an edit that skips this step is silent --
// it strands every repository already on the old text and nothing says
// so. The list only ever grows: an entry deleted is a repository that
// can never be adopted, and there is no way to find out from here
// whether one is still out there.

// earlierWorkflows are the templates earlier builds rendered this file
// from, newest first. Each is the whole template, `@IMAGE@` included, as
// the commit named in its comment held it -- so matching one is the same
// prefix/suffix comparison RenderedImage makes against the current one.
var earlierWorkflows = []string{earlierWorkflow3, earlierWorkflow2, earlierWorkflow1}

// earlierWorkflow3 is the template as commit b898473e wrote it: the
// first one whose IMAGE line grain maintained, and so the first whose

// carries it.

# grain writes this file whenever it is not here -- on the sync after a

# which it keeps pointed at the build the deployment is actually
# running. So an edit to it is safe: change the runner, add a step of
# your own, and grain leaves the file alone from then on, image
# included. To pin the image and keep the rest of this file grain's,
# set "checkImage" in the deployment's state-repo.json -- that is what
# IMAGE is written from. To stop grain offering the file at all, set
# "noWorkflow": true there instead.
