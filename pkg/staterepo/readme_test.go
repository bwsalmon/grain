// Whose state this is. The README is the only prose in the repository,
// and it is what somebody reading a clone -- or an agent handed a
// checkout it did not clone -- has to go on: every deployment exports
// the same files holding the same tables, so without the name in here
// two installations' dumps cannot be told apart by looking at them.
//
// The properties worth pinning are the two edges of that. The name has
// to reach the file grain commits, from the seed and from every sync
// after it, and formatting a clone must not write it back out. And the
// unnamed deployment -- the default, since EnvironmentName is free text
// nobody has to set -- has to keep the README it already had, to the
// byte: this file is rewritten on every sync, so a rendering that moved
// a space would be a commit and a push on the next tick of every
// deployment that upgrades.
