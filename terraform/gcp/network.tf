# admits 35.235.240.0/20 to port 22 on anything but the host, so
# `gcloud compute ssh --tunnel-through-iap` hangs and then times out --
# and instanceAdmin.v1 can read firewall rules but not create them, so
# the agent cannot open the path itself either.
#
# Scoped to its own tag rather than the whole network so this does not
# silently become a second way in to the host (or to any unrelated
# instance an operator runs here), and so an instance created without the
# tag stays unreachable by default. Reaching through this range at all
# still requires roles/iap.tunnelResourceAccessor, exactly as
