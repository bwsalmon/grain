// `/review` and `/depends` are v1 directives this package does not
// support yet: continuing an existing PR and posting a review both need a
// dispatch shape (which branch to check out, review vs. implement intent)
// this package's own RunDispatch does not build yet either, so parsing
// them here would just be dead data. Follow-on work, tracked alongside
// RunDispatch's own single-Intent limitation.

// neither directiveRe nor anything else, so it was silently treated as
// ordinary prose instead of the one clear typo it invites). Equivalent
// to `/auto-merge true`.
