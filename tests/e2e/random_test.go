// TestRandomizedClusterEndToEnd and TestRandomizedClusterLong are
// bwsalmon/agents#338's randomized counterpart to cli_test.go's one fixed
// scenario: rather than a human, an agent and GitHub each taking one
// scripted turn, every one of the three takes many turns, each one a
// random choice among whatever is actually valid for a task's current
// state -- file a task, approve a proposal, answer a parked question,
// close or reopen a task (the operator, driven through the real grain CLI
// binary, exactly as cli_test.go's own doc comment explains that choice);
// push, fail or ask a question (the agent, scripted the same way
// harness_test.go's pushScript/failScript/askScript already are -- see
// randomPushScript's own doc comment for the two ways this loop's version
// has to differ -- except the choice of which script is made live, once
// dispatch.Cycle -- inside a real orchestrator.RunCycle now, not by hand
// -- reveals which task and branch this turn is for); and merge a clean
// pull request (a real
// github.Client call against a real githubsim.Sim, the same double
// live_test.go and cli_test.go already use instead of the real network).
//
// This is not simulate_test.go over again. That file already randomizes
// several users filing issues across several rounds, but it calls
// dispatch.Cycle and the GitHub-sync stand-in's store.Observe calls
// directly -- it never touches the CLI binary a human actually runs, nor
// a real github.Client/githubsim pair. What only a test built the way
// this one is can catch: a CLI subprocess racing the orchestrator through
// a store that permits one writer at a time (withStore's own doc comment
// explains why opening and closing around every step is the point, not
// ceremony), and a merge that only really lands once githubsim's own
// mergeIntoBase moves real commits -- not just a PR's State field, the
// way e2e's own mergeBranchIntoDefault stands in for a human's click
// but githubsim.Sim.mergeIntoBase's own doc comment explains a fake that
// only flipped State would miss.
//
// The invariant checks inside runRandomizedCluster's own round loop below
// are what this whole exercise is actually checking: after every round, a
// slot RunCycle claimed must be free again (RunDispatch always calls
// FinishRun before RunCycle returns, so nothing here should ever see one
// still occupied -- catching exactly the "cluster blocks" failure mode
// bwsalmon/agents#338 asked to guard against), every branch a scripted
// agent turn actually confirmed pushed must still exist, every branch
// this loop merged must actually be an ancestor of main, and the task
// count the CLI itself reports must never drop -- nothing here ever
// deletes a task, so a lower count next round means one silently
// vanished.
//
// TestRandomizedClusterEndToEnd runs a short, fixed-seed version of this
// loop as part of the ordinary suite (`cd v2 && go test ./...`).
// TestRandomizedClusterLong is the same driver, run for much longer, with
// no seed fixed unless one is given -- see its own doc comment for how to
// run it by hand; it does nothing at all unless asked to, so `go test
// ./...` never pays for it.
