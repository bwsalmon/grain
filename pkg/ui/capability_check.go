// nothing here changes CapabilityStatus.Ready, and a second call a
// minute later may say something else -- which is the honest shape for a
// question only somebody else's API can answer. See Client.

	// Detail is one sentence a human can act on: on success, what came
	// back (how many keys the account has, which installation
	// answered), which is the evidence that this credential is live
	// rather than merely present; on failure, the provider's own
	// explained error -- gcpkey.explainRefusedCredential's sentence

// end refused, and a capability this deployment never configured, both
// arrive here as errors and are reported as a CapabilityCheck with OK
// false carrying the error's own text. Only grain's own gaps -- an
// unwired UI, an unknown id, a capability with no check written for it

// CheckCapability authenticates as id's standing credential and makes
// one cheap, harmless call with it -- gcp-key lists the agent service
// account's own keys, exactly as Reap does; gemini-key lists the
// project's API keys; github-sandbox asks GitHub which installation its
// App has -- and reports what came back.
//
// This is the one question Settings could not previously ask. "Ready"
// there means *configured*: a project, an agent account and a
// `gcp-key-minter` secret are all set. The key inside that secret can
// have been deleted or rotated away in GCP months ago and every one of
// those three facts stays true, so the pane agrees with itself while
// every mint fails with `invalid_grant` (README.md's "Debugging
// `gcp-key` again"). Only the far end knows, and only when something
// authenticates with it.
//
// **On demand, not on a schedule**, and that is the design rather than
// the easy half of it. A background poll would keep the badge itself
// truthful, at the price of two things worth more: every poll is a real
// request to somebody else's API, per capability, forever, whether or
// not anybody is looking; and "Ready" would become a thing that changes
// with nobody touching Settings, so a badge that went red overnight
// would carry no answer to "compared to when, and did anything here
// change?". A button costs one round trip that a human asked for and
// gives an answer stamped with the moment it was true.
//
// **It never mints, writes or deletes anything.** A check somebody is
// expected to press repeatedly must not leave resources behind for a
// reaper to collect, and must not need permission beyond what an
// ordinary Materialize already has -- see model.CredentialChecker.
//
// An unknown id, or one grain ships no check for, is a ValidationError
// (a 400): those are mistakes about grain rather than answers about this
// deployment. Everything the provider itself says -- refused, not
// configured, API disabled -- comes back as an ordinary CapabilityCheck
// with OK false, because each of those is a real answer to the question
// asked, with a remedy on this deployment.
