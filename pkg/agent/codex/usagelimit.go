// agent/claude's usagelimit.go has the reasoning all three frameworks
// share: a run that ends because the credential it runs as has no budget
// left in its current window is not a run that failed on its own terms,
// and retrying it -- or dispatching the next task -- spends the whole
// queue on the same refusal. agent.UsageLimitError is how that is said
// to orchestrator.RunDispatch, which pauses dispatch until the window
// resets instead.
//
// What differs is the vocabulary. codex reports a plan's own ceiling in
// words ("you've hit your usage limit", "try again in 4h 12m") and the
// API's in the error body it passes through (a 429's
// rate_limit_exceeded, an insufficient_quota). Both end up in the same
// agent.UsageLimitError; the relative "try again in" becomes its
// RetryAfter, the same field agent/antigravity fills from the Gemini
// API's own retryDelay.
const usageLimitFramework = "codex"

// usageLimitMarkers are the phrases that mean "out of budget" in codex's
// own report of a failed run. Lowercase, matched against a lowercased
// haystack.
//
// A bare "429" is deliberately absent, for the reason both other
// frameworks give: it is three digits that a repository's own files and
// test output are full of, and some of that text passes through this
// same stream.

// retryAfterPattern is codex's own "come back in", as it words a plan

// three separate optional groups say.

// usageLimitFailure reads a failed run's own account of itself -- the
// stream's terminal failure text and whatever the subprocess reported --
// and returns the limit it describes, or nil when it describes something
// else entirely (which is every ordinary failure).
//
// Like agent/antigravity and unlike agent/claude there is no second,
// stricter reading for a *successful* run: codex reports a limit by
// failing the turn, never as the run's final answer, so nothing here has
// to tell the model quoting the phrase apart from the CLI reporting it.
