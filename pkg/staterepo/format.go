package staterepo

// format.go lays out a state repository that does not have one yet, and
// writes the CI step that keeps changes to it honest.
//
// Everything else in this package answers "what does a running
// deployment do with a repository". This file answers the question that
// comes before that one: an operator has just created an empty
// repository on GitHub and has nothing in it, and the parts of a state
// repository that are not the dump -- the README that says what the
// tree is, the .gitignore that keeps a stray key out of it, and the
// workflow that runs `grain state check` against a proposed change --
// have until now existed only once a deployment had seeded it, and the
// workflow has not existed at all.
//
// Two things are deliberately not here.
//
// No dump. Formatting writes no tables/ and no schema-version stamp, so
// HasDump stays false and the repository stays the "empty repository
// grain seeds from what it has" of the bootstrap. Writing an empty dump
// would be easy -- an empty database at this build's schema exports one
// file per table -- and would quietly turn adopting into the *other*
// case, the one where the repository's contents replace the database.
// An operator who formatted a new repository and then adopted it would
// have emptied their deployment, and would have been told they were
// adopting an existing repository, which by then would have been true.
//
// No commit, and no push. Format writes files into a directory and
// stops, because it runs in a clone somebody made and has no business
// making commits there.
//
// installWorkflow, at the bottom of this file, is the other half of the
// same job and the one that runs on the deployment: Seed and every Sync
// call it, so a repository grain was pointed at ends up with the check
// whether or not anybody ran a command, and one whose workflow a merge
// dropped gets it back on the next tick. It carries the risk `format`
// was written to avoid -- a push that adds a file under
// .github/workflows is refused unless the credential making it may
// write workflows, and grain's own installation token need not be able
// to -- and it carries it in the one shape where that is survivable: the
// workflow is a commit of its own, pushed on its own, and undone in full
// whenever that push does not land -- for whatever reason, since a
// commit left behind is a commit the *export's* next push carries, which
// is where a refusal would take the export down with it. A deployment
// whose credential says no loses the CI step and nothing else, and is
// told in its journal how to install the file by hand.

// DefaultCheckImage is the container the generated CI step runs

//
// grain publishes no bare binaries -- one image per commit is the whole
// of what CI releases (../../.github/workflows/build-artifacts.yml), and
// its entrypoint is the grain binary, so `docker run <image> state check
// /state` is the command. `:latest` is main's, and public, which is what
// makes the generated workflow need no credential of any kind: a state
// repository's own GITHUB_TOKEN cannot read another repository's private
// packages, and a step that needed one would be a step an operator has
// to configure before it works.
//
// It is a default rather than a constant in the workflow because the
// check is only meaningful against a build that knows the same schema as
// the deployment (Check refuses any other), so a deployment pinned to an
// older tag wants that tag here. A deployment does not have to be told
// which one it is: cmd/grain stamps its own image reference in at link
// time and passes it as Config.CheckImage, exactly as it does for the
// sandbox (cmd/grain/grainimage.go), and this value is what an unstamped
// build -- a `make build` on a laptop, a `docker build` with no build arg
// -- falls back to. Naming the tag CI keeps pointed at main is a less
// precise answer than that stamp and a far better one than nothing.

	// for its own reasons, and a credential that may not write workflows
	// -- which is the case this whole shape was built for.
	//
	// What the undo costs instead is one commit that never left this host
	// and is made again on a later tick. The one case it is not free is a
	// push the remote accepted and git reported as failed anyway, where
	// the remote now holds a commit this tree has reset away: the next
