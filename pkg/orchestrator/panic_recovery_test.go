// bwsalmon/agents#550: cmd/grain's own daemon.go now keeps the UI/API
// server up even when the rest of the daemon fails, but that only helps
// if RunCycle itself never takes the whole process down first. Before
// recoverReconcile/recoverRunOne (cycle.go) existed, a panic anywhere in
// a Reconciler, or in any one dispatch's own goroutine, was completely
// unrecovered: it would have crashed this test binary the same way it
// would have crashed a real grain daemon (UI/API server included, since
// bwsalmon/agents#363 folded them into one process) rather than merely
// failing the one thing that panicked. The two tests below each panic
// somewhere RunCycle reaches and prove the process survives to report a
// normal error instead -- and, following isolationTest's own pattern,
// that unrelated work in the same cycle still lands.
