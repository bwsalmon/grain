// Divergence: the one shape of trouble this repository can get into that
// nothing else here can talk its way out of.
//
// How a deployment arrives at it is ordinary enough. grain commits its
// export and then pushes it; if that push fails -- an installation token
// that expired between the commit and the network call, a remote that is
// briefly unreachable -- the commit stays on this host. If a pull request
// against the state repository is merged before the next push succeeds,
// the remote now holds a commit on the other side of the same parent, and
// Pull is fast-forward only by design: it refuses rather than resolving a
// conflict in a database dump by guesswork.
//
// That refusal is right, and until now nothing cleared it. Every tick
// logged the same divergence, no merged change was ever applied, and no
// export ever reached the remote again until somebody went to the host
// and fixed the working tree by hand -- which, now that the daemon pulls
// on its own timer rather than only at startup, is a state a deployment
// stays in for as long as it runs.
//
// The way out is narrow on purpose. There is exactly one case where grain
// can resolve this itself without deciding anything on a human's behalf:
// every local commit the remote has not got is grain's own export. Those
// commits carry only what the database already holds, so throwing them
// away loses nothing by construction -- the export that runs immediately
// afterwards writes the same rows straight back out, on top of whatever
// was merged. Anything else -- a commit somebody made by hand in the
// working tree, a remote whose history was rewritten under a commit we
// had already pulled -- stays a loud refusal, because that is a human's
// to resolve and no amount of resetting makes it not be.

// RecoverDiverged clears a divergence that is grain's own to clear, by

//
// It resets only when every commit this host has that the remote does not
// is one of grain's own exports (ownExport, below). That is the whole of
// the safety argument and it is worth stating plainly: an export commit
// holds a dump of the database, the database is still right here, and the
// caller's next export writes it back out over whatever arrived from the
// remote. So the reset destroys a commit and destroys no information.
// A commit that is not an export might hold something that exists nowhere
// else, so it is never reset over -- the divergence is reported instead,
// naming the commit that blocks it, and an operator resolves it.
//
// Callers are expected to Apply and export straight afterwards: this
// function only moves the working tree, and a tree sitting on the
// remote's branch with a database that has not taken it up is exactly
// the state Apply exists to resolve. The daemon does both -- see

// resolves it, not a reset that would throw the commit away.
