// PullRequestStatus is one task's pull request as OpenPullRequestForTask

// actually wants, since the whole reason to open one before the run ends
// is to see what the repo's own checks make of the branch.

	// list otherwise.

	// ChecksError carries a failure to read checks without failing the

// OpenPullRequestForTask opens (or finds) the pull request for task's own
// branch and reports its current checks -- what a still-running dispatch
// asks for through the open_pull_request tool (pkg/mcp), so an agent can
// watch the repo's own CI run against the branch it just pushed rather
// than exiting blind and learning nothing until a human reads the pull
// request the finish path opened for it.
//
// It is deliberately the same pull request finishWithPullRequest would
// have opened at the end of the run: same branch (model.BranchName), same
// base, same title, same body, through the same EnsurePullRequest. A run
// that calls this has moved *when* its pull request appears, not what
// appears -- and because EnsurePullRequest finds an already-open pull
// request for the branch before opening one, the finish path that follows
// adopts this very pull request rather than trying (and failing) to open
// a second one for the same head.
//
// What it deliberately does not do is anything that ends the task.
// CompletedAt stays unset -- the run is still live, and setting it here
// would hand a still-running task to SyncPullRequests' merge queue, which
// could merge a branch the agent is still pushing to. Ending the task is
// finishWithPullRequest's job, on the finish path, once the run is
// actually over. (Store.OpenPullRequestLinks only returns links belonging
// to a completed task, so a pull request opened here is not synced or
// merged by anything until that has happened.)
//
// A branch that is there but empty is answered in the same spirit and
// for the same reason, a little further down: "commit something first"
// rather than GitHub's 422 about a head with no commits over its base.
// The finish path ends a task over that condition; this one deliberately
// does not touch the task at all, since the run asking is still running
// and committing something is a thing it can still do.
//
// Two checks come first, both mirroring the finish path's own. The
// branch, through the same branchExistsSettled, so an agent that calls
// this before pushing gets "push it first" back rather than GitHub's own
// 422 about a head that does not exist. And the task's own closure, read
// fresh from the store, because a human closing a task mid-run is
// answered the same way salvagePushedBranch answers it: nobody wants a
// closed task's work turned into a pull request, and the run this call
// came from is about to be cancelled for the same reason.
