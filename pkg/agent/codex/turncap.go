// stdout to enforce RunConfig.MaxTurns. codex has no --max-turns flag to
// push the cap down into the binary (see this package's own doc
// comment), so the cap is counted here instead, off the same events the
// transcript is built from: every completed assistant message is one
// turn, and reaching max cancels the run's context, which
// procgroup.Prepare turns into a kill of codex and its MCP child both.
//
// It is agent/antigravity's turnCap over codex's own vocabulary, down to
// the reasoning: counting on the live stream rather than on the finished
// capture is the whole point -- a cap applied after the process exits
// would report a runaway run without ever having stopped one.
//
// Writes arrive as arbitrary byte chunks, not whole lines: exec.Cmd
// copies whatever it reads from the pipe. A partial trailing line is
// therefore held in buf and completed by a later write, rather than
// being parsed (and miscounted, or dropped) as if it were whole.
