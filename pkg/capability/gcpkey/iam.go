// explainCreateFailure names which way minting actually failed, in a

// own message reads like a bug in grain rather than like one unrun setup
// step, on a deployment where Settings has already said **Ready**
// because a project, an account and a secret are all set. Nothing on any
// configuration pane can see whether the *project* was ever finished.
//
// Four causes, each with a different remedy:
//
//   - 403 with SERVICE_DISABLED -- iam.googleapis.com was never enabled.
//   - 403 otherwise -- the minter holds no roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin
//     on the agent account. `grain setup gcp` is the one command that
//     fixes either, so both name it.
//   - 404 -- Settings names a service account that does not exist in this
//     project (a typo, or the wrong project), which is a configuration
//     answer rather than a GCP one.
//   - 400 FAILED_PRECONDITION -- two entirely different things, told
//     apart below.
//
// That last split is the bug this function had. bwsalmon/agents#140
// added it for the key-quota case, whose raw text ("FAILED_PRECONDITION:
// Precondition check failed") names nothing at all -- but it then
// answered *every* FAILED_PRECONDITION with the quota explanation. The
// far more common one on a modern project is the organization policy
// constraints/iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation, which forbids
// user-managed service-account keys outright and is enforced by default
// in organizations created since 2024. An operator whose org forbids
// keys was being told, with a count of 0 in the sentence, that grain was
// creating keys faster than it releases them -- sending them to look for
// a leak that is not there, in the one case where no amount of looking
// at grain can help. The count decides it now: the quota explanation is
// given only when the account is actually at the cap.
//
// Never worse than the original error, on every path: GCP's own message
// is wrapped, never replaced, and a listing that fails while counting
// leaves the two possibilities named rather than one of them asserted.
