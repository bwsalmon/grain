package e2e

// The two halves of "grain writes a denial into every run's HOME" that a
// real agy can be asked about without spending a model turn: did it load
// the hook, and did it load the permission rules.
//
// Everything else in this repository that covers those files reads the
// bytes agent/antigravity produces, which says that grain wrote what it
// meant to write and nothing at all about whether agy opened the file.
// That distinction is not academic here. agy validates neither file on
// load -- a hooks.json it cannot make sense of leaves a run with no hooks
// and no complaint, an unknown settings key is ignored in silence -- so
// the failure mode this pair guards against is not an error message, it
// is a run that quietly has no denial in front of its tools. grain has
// already shipped exactly that once, with an MCP config written to a path
// agy stopped reading, and a green suite the whole time.
//
// Print mode is what makes this cheap: `agy -p /hooks` and
// `agy -p /permissions` answer out of the config it just loaded, without
// an agent turn and without a valid credential, so these tests need agy
// on PATH and nothing else. They sit here rather than in
// pkg/agent/antigravity because that package's tests must pass on the
// pull-request runner, which has no agy -- and they are named TestLive*
// so live-agent.yml's nightly `-run TestLive` picks them up beside the
// tests that do spend a credential.
