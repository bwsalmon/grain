// Whether the daemon's own loop keeps working while a run is in flight.
//
// pkg/orchestrator proves RunCycle hands a dispatch off rather than
// waiting for it (concurrent_dispatch_test.go); this proves the half
// that only exists here: reconcile ticks again while an agent is still
// running, so a task filed a moment after a run started is dispatched
// within a poll interval rather than after however long that run takes,
// and drainInFlight waits for what is still live once the loop stops.
